All cell lines and cervical cancer tissues showed a similar miRNA expression profile ... An expression abundance analysis, based on a signal density ≥20,000, showed that both normal and cancerous cervical tissues had abundant expression of miR-23a, miR-23b, let-7a, let-7c, and let-7d, whereas high expression of miR-26a, miR-29a, miR-99a, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-143, miR-145, miR195, and miR-199a was only observed in normal cervical tissues, and high expression of miR-16, miR-21, miR-205, and let-7f was only observed in cervical cancer tissues, despite that relatively low levels of miR-16 and miR-21 were noticed from a homogeneous cell population in some cell lines (Fig. 2B) | Discourse Facet: | Run ID: BLLIP 1

A construct spanning Tsg101 residues 1–145 was used to characterize the interaction between HIV-1NL4-3 p6 and the Tsg101 UEV domain in vitro ... Others have shown that the HIV-1 p6 late domain can mediate virus release from human embryonic kidney 293T cells (Yuan et al., 2000), and we confirmed that a series of mutations in the p6 PTAP sequence that block HIV-1 release and replication in other cell lines also blocked release of infectious HIV-1 particles in 293T cells (data not shown) | Discourse Facet: | Run ID: BLLIP 1

These molecules have been formulated for intravenous administration in the clinic, and MK-0457 has shown some activity as salvage therapy for advanced phase CML patients harboring the T315I mutation (Giles et al., 2007), but clinical development has been halted due to toxicity concerns ... Thus, as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib each form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of T315 in native ABL, we designed ligands devoid of this interaction by introducing vinyl and ethyl linkages into a purine-based inhibitor scaffold (Wang et al., 2008) targeting both DFG-in (active) and DFG-out (inactive) binding modes | Discourse Facet: | Run ID: BLLIP 1

The identification of multiple proteins that preferentially interact with active Ras raises the potential for multiple effector pathways, and has led to a number of studies attempting to elucidate the critical oncogenic signaling pathways downstream of Ras (for recent review, see Repasky et al., 2004) ... While our data provide evidence for RalGDS involvement in Ras-dependent tumor formation, further studies will be needed to evaluate the requirements for RalGDS in other oncogenic pathways not dependent on Ras activation | Discourse Facet: | Run ID: BLLIP 1

The mutations fall into two groups. The first group includes mutations at sites that directly contact imatinib (T315, F317, and F359) and presumably impair drug binding without significantly affecting the binding of ATP (Figure 2A, red spheres) ...

The RIP1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) (Degterev et al., 2008) also abolished RIP1 recruitment to FADD and inhibited additional RIP3 binding to the complex (Fig. 4A, lane 4 and Fig. S6) ... By contrast, siRNA-mediated silencing of RIP1 or RIP3 inhibited zVAD-fmk-induced necrosis in L929 cells (Fig. 5F-G), which was recently shown to be driven by autocrine TNF production (Hitomi et al., 2008) | Discourse Facet: | Run ID: BLLIP 1

Confocal microscopy revealed that PTPN12 loss of function significantly increased ectopic proliferation (Figures S1B and S1C) but did not lead to a compensatory increase in apoptosis (data not shown) like other oncogenic insults (Debnath et al., 2002), consistent with the significantly expanded cellularity and filled lumen in acini upon PTPN12 depletion ...

This work indicates that membrane signals control the activity of the mammalian SWI/SNF or BAF complex and demonstrates a direct interface between signaling and chromatin regulation ... This view (Lewin 1994) is inspired by the observation that the mammalian SWI/SNF complex is over ten times the molecular weight of a nucleosome and has two ATPases and one potential ATPase (Khavari et al. 1993, and this study) | Discourse Facet: | Run ID: BLLIP 1

The competition by C/EBP? and the granulocytic differentiation are favored by a negative-feedback loop in which miR-223 represses NFI-A translation ...

Instead, activation of BAX and/or BAK by activator BH3-only proteins like BIM or BID is required ...

We therefore hypothesized that conserved regions in mRNAs may serve as docking platforms for modulators of miRNA activity ... In animals, miRNAs utilize a seed sequence at their 5? end (nt 2–8) to associate with 3?UTR regions of mRNAs to suppress gene expression by inhibiting translation that occasionally is associated with mRNA decay (Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005) | Discourse Facet: | Run ID: BLLIP 1
