We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53 ... Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the expression of miR-372/3 suppresses the p53 pathway to an extent sufficient to allow oncogenic mutations to accumulate in TGCTs ... However, whereas in the majority of the cases neoplastic transformation will require inactivation of p53 (for example by expression of HPV E6, HDM2, or mutant p53), miR372&3 uniquely allowed transformation to occur while p53 was active | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  A |

Using quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, we observed a 2-fold effect on LATS2 RNA levels and 4- to 5-fold on protein levels by the miR-371-3 cluster (Figure 5C). As a control, we used a LATS2 knockdown construct (Figure 5F). These results show that a combined effect of RNA destruction and translation inhibition is used by miR-372&3 to silence LATS2. miR-372/3 was predicted to bind two sites in the 3′UTR of LATS2 that are highly conserved between human, mouse, and zebrafish (Figure 5D). To further substantiate LATS2 as a direct target of miR372&3, we cloned its 3′UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-LATS2). We transfected either pGL3-LATS2 or the controls pGL3-372 and pGL3-373 (containing a miR-complementary sequence in their 3′UTR) or pGL3 into Tera1 and MCF-7 cells (respectively positive and negative for miR-371-3) ( Figures 4D and S6). As predicted, the 372/373 complementary sequences mediated strong inhibition of luciferase expression in Tera1 cells. Significantly, a potent inhibition of luciferase activity was also mediated by the 3′UTR of LATS2 in either MCF-7 ectopically expressing miR-372 or in Tera1 cells but not by a construct mutated at both miR-372-predicted target sites ... Next, we tested whether LATS2 is a functional target of miR-372&3 using a YFP-competition assay. Indeed, inhibition of LATS2 conferred a growth advantage to cells expressing RASV12 (Figure 5F). The overall effect was less than the effect of the miR-Vec 373 but comparable to loss of p53. Therefore, these results point to LATS2 as a mediator of the miR-372 and miR-373 effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, although they do not exclude the participation of other direct miR-targets, such as Suv39-H1, in these processes | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B |

In this context, while the development of TGCTs would be allowed by a partial functional inactivation of p53 (see [53], [54]), such mechanism would be insufficient to counteract the pro-apoptotic function of p53 induced by a persistent damage, causing a rapid cell death | Reference Offset: ['21571-22172', '26352-26530'] | Reference Text:  Since cells expressing miR-372&3 proliferate in the presence of increased p21cip1 levels, we examined their response to damaged DNA. In the presence of both miRNAs, and irrespective of RASV12 expression, IR induced a cell cycle arrest that was indistinguishable from control cells, whereas the suppression of p53 expression allowed, as expected, continuous DNA replication (Figure 4C and data not shown). These results indicate that although miR-372&3 confer complete protection to oncogene-induced senescence in a manner similar to p53 inactivation, the cellular response to DNA damage remains intact ... Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the expression of miR-372/3 suppresses the p53 pathway to an extent sufficient to allow oncogenic mutations to accumulate in TGCTs | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C |

First, reduced REST function (mediated by RNAi or expression of dominant-negative REST) promotes transformation of human epithelial cells. Conversely, reconstitution of REST expression elicits a dramatic proliferation defect in colon cancer cells that have lost endogenous REST function. Strikingly, an independent aCGH-based search for genomic loci characterized by recurrent microdeletions identified the REST locus as a high-confidence target in colorectal cancer. This high-confidence list includes two previously established tumor suppressors, p16INK4A and TGFβRII (Derynck et al., 2001, Ruas and Peters, 1998 and Siegel and Massague, 2003), the latter of which was also identified as a SECT gene.

Intriguingly, a variety of human tumors including those arising in breast, ovary, and lung activate expression of neuron-specific genes. In some instances, the inappropriate expression of these neural genes elicits an autoimmune response that culminates in neurological disorders, collectively known as paraneoplastic neurologic degenerations (PND; see Discussion) ( Albert and Darnell, 2004). Such aberrant neural gene expression suggests that these cancers harbor defects in regulators of neuronal programs. Consequently, we investigated a potential role for REST in human tumor suppression ... REST is widely expressed throughout nonneuronal tissues including the colonic epithelium (Figure S1) (Chong et al., 1995 and Schoenherr and Anderson, 1995). The above results suggest that loss of REST expression may confer a selective advantage during the evolution of tumor cells. This hypothesis predicts that cells with defective REST function may be sensitive to reconstitution of REST. We examined this prediction by ectopically expressing REST in colon cancer cells that have lost (SW1417) or retain (SW620) endogenous REST expression (Figure 4A). Exogenous REST expression elicited a mild decrease in the proliferation of SW620 colon cancer cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, ectopic REST expression significantly reduced colony formation in SW1417 cells (>50-fold; Figure 4B), indicating that these cells are highly dependent on the absence of REST for their proliferation in vitro. Coupled with the function of REST in suppressing epithelial cell transformation (Figure 1E), these data strongly support a role for REST in tumor suppression | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  E, |

For example, the joint expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT), oncogenic H-RASV12, and SV40-small t antigen combined with the suppression of p53 and p16INK4A were sufficient to render primary human fibroblasts tumorigenic (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).

In such models, primary cells are transformed into tumorigenic derivatives by the coexpression of cooperating oncogenes (Elenbaas et al., 2001, Hahn et al., 1999 and Zhao et al., 2004). These experimental models have been useful in delineating the minimum genetic perturbations required for transformation of various human cell types as well as evaluating the functional cooperation between a gene of interest and a defined genetic context. To date, these models of human cell transformation have incorporated genes already implicated in human tumorigenesis. However, such models also provide a potentially useful platform for the identification of new pathways that contribute to the transformed phenotype ... We have utilized such an RNAi-based, forward genetic approach to identify genes that suppress oncogenic transformation in a defined human mammary epithelial cell model. We identified approximately 25 potential suppressors of epithelial cell transformation (SECT) genes that represent candidate tumor suppressors.

The immediate effect of Ras in primary cells is mitogenic, as indicated by microinjection studies in primary human and rodent fibroblasts ( 42, 64 and 59). Also, the cell-cycle arrest induced by ras in our studies is not immediate but occurs after a lag period, typically becoming complete by day 2 of the experimental scheme shown in Figure 1 (day 7 after the intitial introduction of H-ras V12). This delayed response is consistent with the existence of a homeostatic mechanism that prevents proliferation after prolonged Ras activation and that is mediated, at least in part, by the induction of p53 and p16 ... We demonstrate that oncogenic ras provokes premature senescence in primary rodent and human cells in association with the induction of p53 and p16.

Within normal tissue, cells are largely instructed to grow by their neighbors (paracrine signals) or via systemic (endocrine) signals. Cell-to-cell growth signaling is likely to operate in the vast majority of human tumors as well; virtually all are composed of several distinct cell types that appear to communicate via heterotypic signaling ... Heterotypic signaling between the diverse cell types within a tumor may ultimately prove to be as important in explaining tumor cell proliferation as the cancer cell-autonomous mechanisms enumerated above. For example, we suspect that many of the growth signals driving the proliferation of carcinoma cells originate from the stromal cell components of the tumor mass. While difficult to validate at present, such thinking recasts the logic of acquired GS autonomy: successful tumor cells are those that have acquired the ability to co-opt their normal neighbors by inducing them to release abundant fluxes of growth-stimulating signals (Skobe and Fusenig 1998). Indeed, in some tumors, these cooperating cells may eventually depart from normalcy, coevolving with their malignant neighbors in order to sustain the growth of the latter (58 and 72). Further, inflammatory cells attracted to sites of neoplasia may promote (rather than eliminate) cancer cells (18, 22 and 46), another example of normal cells conscripted to enhance tumor growth potential, another means to acquire necessary capabilities ... cancer development depends upon changes in the heterotypic interactions between incipient tumor cells and their normal neighbors.

The paths that cells take on their way to becoming malignant are highly variable. Within a given cancer type, mutation of particular target genes such as ras or p53 may be found in only a subset of otherwise histologically identical tumors. Further, mutations in certain oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can occur early in some tumor progression pathways and late in others. As a consequence, the acquisition of biological capabilities such as resistance to apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis, and unlimited replicative potential can appear at different times during these various progressions. Accordingly, the particular sequence in which capabilities are acquired can vary widely, both among tumors of the same type and certainly between tumors of different types ( Figure 4). Furthermore, in certain tumors, a specific genetic event may, on its own, contribute only partially to the acquisition of a single capability, while in others, this event may aid in the simultaneous acquisition of several distinct capabilities.

While difficult to validate at present, such thinking recasts the logic of acquired GS autonomy: successful tumor cells are those that have acquired the ability to co-opt their normal neighbors by inducing them to release abundant fluxes of growth-stimulating signals (Skobe and Fusenig 1998). Indeed, in some tumors, these cooperating cells may eventually depart from normalcy, coevolving with their malignant neighbors in order to sustain the growth of the latter (58 and 72).

We anticipate that new technologies will be able to display the apoptotic pathways still operative in specific types of cancer cells and that new drugs will enable cross-talk between the still intact components of parallel apoptotic signaling pathways in tumor cells, resulting in restoration of the apoptotic defense mechanism, with substantial therapeutic benefit ... We envision that evolving analytic techniques will soon make it possible to construct comprehensive profiles of the expression and functional activities of proteases, integrins, and CAMs in a wide variety of cancer types, both before and after they acquire invasive and metastatic abilities.

Transgenic models of tumorigenesis have repeatedly supported the conclusion that tumorigenesis in mice involves multiple rate-limiting steps (Bergers et al., 1998; see Oncogene, 1999, R. DePinho and T. E. Jacks, volume 18[38], pp. 5248–5362) ... The ability of tumor cell populations to expand in number is determined not only by the rate of cell proliferation but also by the rate of cell attrition. Programmed cell death—apoptosis—represents a major source of this attrition.

This liberation from dependence on exogenously derived signals disrupts a critically important homeostatic mechanism that normally operates to ensure a proper behavior of the various cell types within a tissue ... We suspect that growth signaling pathways suffer deregulation in all human tumors. Although this point is hard to prove rigorously at present, the clues are abundant (Hunter 1997). For example, in the best studied of tumors—human colon carcinomas—about half of the tumors bear mutant ras oncogenes ( Kinzler and Vogelstein 1996) ... Heterotypic signaling between the diverse cell types within a tumor may ultimately prove to be as important in explaining tumor cell proliferation as the cancer cell-autonomous mechanisms enumerated above. For example, we suspect that many of the growth signals driving the proliferation of carcinoma cells originate from the stromal cell components of the tumor mass. While difficult to validate at present, such thinking recasts the logic of acquired GS autonomy: successful tumor cells are those that have acquired the ability to co-opt their normal neighbors by inducing them to release abundant fluxes of growth-stimulating signals (Skobe and Fusenig 1998) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Immunostaining data with the anti-phosphorylated S83 antibody reveals that S83 on Lats2 is phosphorylated in vivo during the cell cycle and it is more prominent during prophase and metaphase than interphase, anapahse and telophase, which is similar to the expression pattern of Aurora-A during the cell cycle (Fig. 4A and Bischoff et al. 1998). These results suggest that S83 on Lats2 is a phosphorylation target of Aurora-A in vivo | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

The importance of complementarity to the 5′ portion of invertebrate miRNAs has been suspected since the observation that complementary sites within the lin-14 mRNA have “core elements” of complementarity to the 5′ segment of the lin-4 miRNA (Wightman et al., 1993) and has been corroborated with the observation that the 5′ segments of numerous invertebrate miRNAs are perfectly complementary to 3′ UTR elements that mediate posttranscriptional regulation or are known miRNA targets Lai 2002 and Stark et al. 2003. Moreover, the 5′ ends of related miRNAs tend to be better conserved than the 3′ ends (Lim et al., 2003b), further supporting the hypothesis that these segments are most critical for mRNA recognition. To explore this hypothesis, TargetScan was applied to predict targets of the nrVert miRNA set conserved between human, mouse, and rat using versions of the algorithm differing in the miRNA heptamer defined as the seed in step 1 (Figure 2B). Consistent with residues at the 5′ end of miRNAs being most important for target recognition, the highest signal:noise ratio was observed when the seed was positioned at or near the extreme 5′ end of the miRNA, with signal:noise values of 2.7, 3.4, and 1.6 observed for seeds at segments 1..7, 2..8, and 3..9, respectively, and signal:noise ratios of 1.3 or less at other seed positions. We suggest that the critical importance of pairing to segment 2..8 for target identification in silico reflects its importance for target recognition in vivo and speculate that this segment nucleates pairing between miRNAs and mRNAs | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

In contrast to p16INK4a and RB, which seem to play specific roles in checkpoint control, the selective involvement of particular D-type cyclins in tumorigenesis may also reflect their normal patterns of tissue-specific expression during development. Consistent with observations that D1, and not D2 or D3, is the major D-type cyclin expressed in both retinal and mammary epithelial tissues, mice lacking cyclin D1 exhibit retinal hypoplasia and defective lobuloalveolar development of breast epithelium during pregnancy ( Fantl et al., 1995 and Sicinski et al., 1995). Conversely, enforced expression of a cyclin D1 transgene in the breast tissue of mice predisposes to mammary cancer ( Wang et al., 1994). Moreover, whereas mice overexpressing Her2/Neu or oncogenic Ras transgenes targeted to mammary epithelium rapidly develop breast cancer, they fail to do so in a cyclin D1 null background, indicating that D1 function is essential for tumorigenesis and that other D-type cyclins in breast tissue cannot compensate ( Yu et al., 2001) ... Susceptibility to familial melanoma was mapped to the INK4a-ARF locus, and the critical mutations in some kindreds affect p16INK4a but not p14ARF function ( Kamb et al., 1994). However, mice lacking Ink4a-Arf rarely develop melanoma unless crossed with animals that express a Ras transgene in appropriate target cells ( Chin et al., 1997 and Bardeesy et al., 2001). When animals containing a mutant Ink4a allele were crossed with mice lacking the entire Ink4a-Arf locus, heterozygotes spontaneously developed melanomas, and dimethylbenzanthrene treatment resulted in a higher frequency of aggressive tumors ( Krimpenfort et al., 2001). Thus, a subtle constellation of genetic events involving p16Ink4a inactivation and Arf haploinsufficiency programs a different outcome than complete loss of Ink4a-Arf, which predisposes to other tumor types ( Serrano et al., 1996) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator: C, |

However, in mouse tumor models lacking functional RB or overexpressing E2F, Arf loss does not invariably diminish apoptosis or accelerate tumorigenesis ( Russell et al., 2002, Tolbert et al., 2002 and Tsai et al., 2002), indicating that E2F can activate p53 through Arf-independent pathways ... A mutant form of E2F (E2F-DB) that binds to DNA but neither interacts with Rb nor transactivates E2F target genes can displace Rb-E2F complexes from promoters. When this mutant was overexpressed in primary MEFs, disruption of Rb-E2F-mediated repression increased the expression of E2F target genes, including Arf ( Rowland et al., 2002). Despite the activation of a persistent p19Arf-mediated p53 response, cells expressing E2F-DB were immortal and resistant to ectopic overexpression of either p19Arf or p53. Therefore, Rb (family)-E2F-mediated repression is required for cell cycle exit in response to p19Arf-p53 activation ... An adenovirus expressing a mutant form of E1A that cannot bind RB should replicate selectively and kill cells lacking functional RB ( Fueyo et al., 2000). A variant in which both the viral E4 and mutant E1A genes are placed under the control of the human E2F1 promoter selectively kills tumor cells with deregulated E2F, whereas normal cells halt viral replication in an RB-dependent manner ( Johnson et al., 2002).

Mutually exclusive events resulting in RB or p16INK4a inactivation through mutation, deletion, or epigenetic silencing, or in the overexpression of cyclin D1 or Cdk4, provide genetic evidence for operation of this signaling pathway in tumor surveillance ... It is notable that mutations affecting the RB pathway generally occur in a mutually exclusive fashion, so that one “hit” (e.g., INK4a mutation) is unaccompanied by others (RB mutation or cyclin D-Cdk overexpression). Interestingly, the frequency of particular genetic events varies among tumor types. For example, in lung cancers, RB loss predominates in small cell tumors, whereas p16INK4a loss occurs in the majority of non-small cell carcinomas | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator: C, |

A progressive increase in p16Ink4a levels as such cells are serially passaged correlates with their diminishing proliferative capacity, arguing for a role for p16Ink4a in cellular senescence (Alcorta et al., 1996, Hara et al., 1996 and Zindy et al., 1997). Stress stemming from a nonphysiologic cell culture environment generates signals that activate p16Ink4a synthesis (Sherr and DePinho, 2000), but its induction can be retarded, or even eliminated, by changing conditions in which primary cells are grown (Ramirez et al., 2001). This argues that p16Ink4a plays a specialized role within the Ink4 family in countering certain signals that abnormally drive cell proliferation, a checkpoint function that is eroded in tumor cells ... There is now compelling evidence that particular components of this regulatory machinery act as tumor suppressors or protooncogenes, whose mutations occur so frequently as to prompt speculation that disabling “the RB pathway” may be essential for the formation of cancer cells (Sherr, 1996, Sellers and Kaelin, 1997, Nevins, 2001, Hahn and Weinberg, 2002 and Ortega et al., 2002).

We next investigated whether C/EBPα physically interacts with the miR-223 promoter and whether its binding correlates with miR-223 transcriptional upregulation. This association was analyzed in vivo during RA-induced granulopoiesis of NB4 and RA-resistant NB4 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (Figure 3). Cells were treated with RA for 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr, and chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with an anti-C/EBPα antibody. DNA from the immunoprecipitates was then amplified by PCR using primers (Oligos#1) located in the promoter region close to the putative C/EBPα binding sites (see schematic representation in Figure 3). C/EBPα was found associated with this region after 24, 48, and 72 hr of RA induction in NB4 cells (lanes NB4 24, 48, and 72), whereas no reactivity was measurable in untreated cells (lane 0) or after 4 hr of RA treatment (lane 4). In NB4-MR4 cells, C/EBPα was not detectable throughout all the RA treatment, with only a faint reactivity at 72 hr (lane group NB4-MR4). These results were confirmed also by quantitative PCR (right panel) ... The specificity of C/EBPα occupancy in the region recognized by Oligos#1 was indicated by the detection of signals close to background levels when sequences located further upstream (Oligos#2) were amplified in the same chromatin preparations.

Remarkably, one of the putative targets of miR-223 identified by computational analysis (Lewis et al., 2005 and Krek et al., 2005) is the transcription factor NFI-A, a CCAAT-related binding protein controlling genes involved in cell growth control, which has been shown to bind sequences related to the ones of C/EBPα (Gronostajski, 2000) ... One of the two C/EBPα binding elements in the miR-223 promoter overlaps with a NFI-A binding site (Meisterernst et al., 1988, Bachurski et al., 1997 and Gronostajski, 2000). Indeed, NFI-A was shown to interact with this sequence in vivo; nevertheless, its binding was released upon RA treatment and substituted by that of C/EBPα. This displacement correlated with miRNA transcriptional upregulation. Notably, in cells resistant to retinoic acid and unable to undergo differentiation, the NFI-A factor remained on the miRNA promoter and no C/EBPα binding was detected. These findings supported the hypothesis of a competition between the two proteins in the regulation of the miRNA promoter: NFI-A produces low levels of miR-223, while C/EBPα is the differentiation-specific activator | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Among the hundreds of predicted regulatory targets of miR-223 (Lewis et al., 2005 and Krek et al., 2005), we noticed transcription factor NFI-A, a protein known to bind sequences related to the ones of C/EBPα (Gronostajski, 2000). Notably, a search in the miR-223 promoter revealed the presence of a NFI-A site (Meisterernst et al., 1988 and Garlatti et al., 1993) overlapping one of the two identified C/EBPα binding sites (see Figure 3) ... The NFI proteins bind as dimers to the dyad symmetric consensus sequence TTGGC(N5)GCCAA; nevertheless, they could also bind very well to individual half-sites, even though with a reduced affinity, and presumably as heterodimers with other proteins (Meisterernst et al., 1988 and Bachurski et al., 1997). Due to the ability to bind to half-sites, the NFI family could somehow compete with the C/EBP factors in binding the CCAAT element (Garlatti et al., 1993). In line with this hypothesis, our experiments indicated a very interesting functional interrelationship between NFI-A and C/EBPα | Discourse Facet:  Hypothesis_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

In line with this, both RNAi against NFI-A and ectopic expression of miR-223 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells enhance differentiation, whereas miR-223 knockdown inhibits the differentiation response to RA. Altogether, our data indicate that miR-223 plays a crucial role during granulopoiesis and point to the NFI-A repression as an important molecular pathway mediating gene reprogramming in this cell lineage ... One of the two C/EBPα binding elements in the miR-223 promoter overlaps with a NFI-A binding site (Meisterernst et al., 1988, Bachurski et al., 1997 and Gronostajski, 2000). Indeed, NFI-A was shown to interact with this sequence in vivo; nevertheless, its binding was released upon RA treatment and substituted by that of C/EBPα. This displacement correlated with miRNA transcriptional upregulation. Notably, in cells resistant to retinoic acid and unable to undergo differentiation, the NFI-A factor remained on the miRNA promoter and no C/EBPα binding was detected.

The sensitization to programmed necrosis by VV infection was also observed in MEFs. While TNF alone did not cause cell death in MEFs (Fig. S6), VV-infected MEFs were highly sensitive to TNF-induced necrosis in a RIP3-dependent manner (Fig. 6D). Electron microscopy confirmed that VV-infected underwent necrotic-like cell death in response to TNF (Fig. 6E, panel c). Importantly, while RIP1-RIP3 complex was only detected when cells were stimulated with T/C/Z (Fig. 4E-G) or TNF/zVAD (Fig. 6F, lanes 3-4), TNF alone was sufficient to trigger RIP1-RIP3 association in VV-infected MEFs (Fig. 6F, lanes 5-8). This is in stark contrast to uninfected cells, in which TNF did not trigger RIP1 and RIP3 interaction (Fig. 6F, lanes 1-2).

Such pro-inflammatory effects might be important for anti-viral immune responses. In addition, programmed necrosis may control the viral factory by eliminating the infected host cells. An anti-viral role for programmed necrosis is further bolstered by our previous findings that certain viral FLIPs (FLICE-like inhibitor proteins) are potent inhibitors of TNF-induced programmed necrosis (Chan et al., 2003). These results suggest that viral inhibition of programmed necrosis is an important immune evasion strategy for certain viruses ... TNF-TNFR interactions are known to be important for the innate immune defense against VV infection (Chan et al., 2003; Ruby et al., 1997). The requirement for RIP3 to induce cell death in VV-infected cells suggests that TNF might confer protection against VV via RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis. To test this hypothesis, we infected wild type and RIP3-/- mice with VV. Consistent with its innate immune protective role, TNF expression was detected in peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) 24 hours post-infection (Fig. 7A). Moreover, TNF expression was induced in the liver and spleen of infected wild type and RIP3-/- mice (Fig. 7B). Thus, virus-induced TNF expression was not impaired in the RIP3-/- mice ... An important role for RIP1/RIP3-mediated programmed necrosis in anti-viral responses is further bolstered by our previous discovery of certain viral FLIPs that potently inhibit programmed necrosis (Chan et al., 2003). More recently, the M45 viral cell death inhibitor from murine cytomegalovirus was shown to interact with RIP1 and RIP3 via the RHIM (Upton et al., 2008).

We show that RIP3 acts upstream to phosphorylate RIP1, which in turn mediates downstream RIP3 phosphorylation. Both RIP3 and the kinase activity of RIP1 are essential for stable formation of the RIP1-RIP3 pro-necrotic complex, which critically controls downstream reactive oxygen species (ROS) production ... Because RIP1 is recruited to both Complex I and Complex II, we examined RIP3 recruitment to these signaling complexes. In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, TNF triggers both apoptosis and programmed necrosis, although apoptosis predominates due to its faster kinetics unless caspases are inhibited (Zheng et al., 2006). In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, RIP3 was recruited to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E), but not to TNFR-1 associated Complex I (Fig. 2F). On short exposure, zVAD-fmk moderately enhanced RIP1 and RIP3 binding to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E). However, the difference was minor and not distinguishable on longer exposure (Fig. S3). On longer exposure, RIP1 cleavage in Complex II was also visible (Fig. S3). Although RIP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D324 might inactivate the RIP1 kinase function and contribute to the bifurcation of apoptosis and programmed necrosis (Lin et al., 1999), zVAD-fmk likely sensitizes cells to programmed necrosis via additional regulatory events because full length RIP1 was still readily detected without caspase inhibition (Fig. S3) ... One physiological situation in which caspases are inhibited and programmed necrosis might be important is during viral infections (Benedict et al., 2002). To test this hypothesis, we examined cell death responses in activated wild type and RIP3-/- T-cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV), which encodes the viral caspase inhibitor B13R/Spi2.

RIP3 regulates necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of RIP1 and RIP3 stabilizes their association within the pro-necrotic complex, activates the pro-necrotic kinase activity, and triggers downstream reactive oxygen species production. The pro-necrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex is induced during vaccinia virus infection. Consequently, RIP3-/- mice exhibited severely impaired virus-induced tissue necrosis, inflammation, and control of viral replication. Thus, RIP3 controls programmed necrosis by initiating the pro-necrotic kinase cascade that is essential for the innate inflammatory response against virus infections ... To further define the molecular regulation of programmed necrosis, we examined the recruitment of RIP1 and RIP3 to Complex II in MEFs because the role of RIP3 in the assembly of the pro-necrotic complex could be evaluated using RIP3-/- MEFs. Similar to Jurkat cells, constitutive association between RIP3 and FADD was also detected in MEFs (Fig. 4A). When programmed necrosis was induced in wild type MEFs with TNF, cycloheximide and zVAD-fmk (T/C/Z) (Fig. S5), RIP1 was recruited to FADD in a TNF-dependent manner (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Moreover, TNF treatment led to further recruitment of RIP3 to the FADD-associated Complex II and RIP3 modification that resembles polyubiquitination (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Strikingly, RIP1 recruitment to Complex II was severely impaired in RIP3-/- MEFs (Fig. 4A, lanes 5-8). The RIP1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) (Degterev et al., 2008) also abolished RIP1 recruitment to FADD and inhibited additional RIP3 binding to the complex (Fig. 4A, lane 4 and Fig. S6). These results indicate that both RIP1 and RIP3 are critical for the assembly of the pro-necrotic Complex II ... Although RIP3 was not identified as a necrosis mediator in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen (Hitomi et al., 2008), we show that formation of a unique pro-necrotic Complex II composed of RIP1 and RIP3 is a crucial first step in the induction of programmed necrosis. RIP3 acts upstream to regulate necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. However, since the level of RIP1 phosphorylation by ectopically expressed RIP3 was low, it remains possible that RIP3 may activate another kinase that directly phosphorylates RIP1.

In this report, we identified RIP3 as a crucial upstream activating kinase that regulates RIP1-dependent programmed necrosis. We show that RIP3 acts upstream to phosphorylate RIP1, which in turn mediates downstream RIP3 phosphorylation. Both RIP3 and the kinase activity of RIP1 are essential for stable formation of the RIP1-RIP3 pro-necrotic complex, which critically controls downstream reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Strikingly, the pronecrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex was specifically induced in the liver upon vaccinia virus (VV) infection. RIP3-/- mice failed to initiate virus-induced tissue necrosis and inflammation, resulting in highly elevated viral replication and mortality. These results show that RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis is important for virus-induced inflammation and innate immune control of viral infections ... Although RIP3 was not identified as a necrosis mediator in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen (Hitomi et al., 2008), we show that formation of a unique pro-necrotic Complex II composed of RIP1 and RIP3 is a crucial first step in the induction of programmed necrosis. RIP3 acts upstream to regulate necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. However, since the level of RIP1 phosphorylation by ectopically expressed RIP3 was low, it remains possible that RIP3 may activate another kinase that directly phosphorylates RIP1. Interestingly, the RIP1 kinase activity is also required for RIP3 phosphorylation during programmed necrosis. Because ectopically expressed RIP1 did not phosphorylate RIP3, RIP1 may facilitate RIP3 phosphorylation by activating another downstream kinase | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

We validated these results in TNFR-2+ wild type Jurkat cells (clone 4E3) and found that individual RIP3-specific siRNAs efficiently reduced RIP3 protein expression (Fig. 1A) and inhibited TNF/zVAD-fmk-induced programmed necrosis (Fig. 1B), but had little or no effects on apoptosis induced by TNF or FasL (Fig. 1C-D). Consistent with a previous report (Newton et al., 2004), RIP3 deficiency did not alter TNF-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1E). Thus, unlike RIP1, RIP3 is a specific activator for programmed necrotic cell death ... RIP3 contains an N-terminal kinase domain with ~ 40% identity with the kinase domain of RIP1 (Fig. 2A). A kinase-defective (KD) RIP3 mutant failed to restore TNF-induced programmed necrosis in Jurkat cells whose endogenous RIP3 expression was silenced by siRNA (Fig. 2B, RIP3-null Jurkat cells), indicating that the RIP3 kinase activity is crucial for programmed necrosis ... In contrast, silencing RIP1 or RIP3 expression in L929 cells had no effect on hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative cell injury (Fig. 5D-E). By contrast, siRNA-mediated silencing of RIP1 or RIP3 inhibited zVAD-fmk-induced necrosis in L929 cells (Fig. 5F-G), which was recently shown to be driven by autocrine TNF production (Hitomi et al., 2008).

In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, TNF triggers both apoptosis and programmed necrosis, although apoptosis predominates due to its faster kinetics unless caspases are inhibited (Zheng et al., 2006). In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, RIP3 was recruited to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E), but not to TNFR-1 associated Complex I (Fig. 2F). On short exposure, zVAD-fmk moderately enhanced RIP1 and RIP3 binding to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E). However, the difference was minor and not distinguishable on longer exposure (Fig. S3). On longer exposure, RIP1 cleavage in Complex II was also visible (Fig. S3). Although RIP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D324 might inactivate the RIP1 kinase function and contribute to the bifurcation of apoptosis and programmed necrosis (Lin et al., 1999), zVAD-fmk likely sensitizes cells to programmed necrosis via additional regulatory events because full length RIP1 was still readily detected without caspase inhibition (Fig. S3) ...

There were 40 somatic TET2 mutations identified in 28/385 patients (7.3% of the ECOG patient cohort). Although only 1 homozygous TET2 mutation was observed, 11 of the 28 TET2-mutant patients had >1 TET2 mutation, consistent with previous studies reporting biallelic TET2 mutations. Of the 40 TET2 mutations, 40% were insertions/deletions resulting in a frameshift mutation, 30% were nonsense mutations, and 30% were somatic missense mutations. AML patients with TET2 mutations did not differ from TET2-wild-type patients in terms of age, sex, cytogenetic risk, or percentage of bone marrow blasts at diagnosis.

Thirty of these genes could be assessed for gene expression (i.e., they were present on the expression arrays used in this study) and 23/30 (77%) were repressed, consistent with the expected effect of hypermethylation.

In this study, LGGs with IDH1/2 mutation tended to exhibit higher LINE-1 methylation although there was no statistical significance | Reference Offset:  ['1047-1571', '3955-4394', '47068-47865'] | Reference Text:  Mutational and epigenetic profiling of a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient cohort revealed that IDH1/2-mutant AMLs display global DNA hypermethylation and a specific hypermethylation signature. Furthermore, expression of 2HG-producing IDH alleles in cells induced global DNA hypermethylation. In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants ... The most prevalent such mutations identified to date affect the genes for cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its mitochondrial homolog IDH2. IDH1 and IDH2 lesions occur in ∼70% of patients with lower-grade (grade II-III) brain tumors such as astrocytomas, as well as in secondary glioblastomas derived from lower-grade glial tumors ( Hartmann et al., 2009, Parsons et al., 2008, van den Bent et al., 2010 and Yan et al., 2009) ... In previous studies in glioma, it was suggested that IDH-mutant brain tumors were characterized by a methylator phenotype which favors the acquisition of IDH1/2 mutations ( Noushmehr et al., 2010). Alternatively, IDH1/2 mutations could be early events in the process of hematopoietic transformation and precede the stochastic acquisition and accumulation of epigenetic changes that eventually culminate in overt AML. However, our data suggest a more direct mechanistic link between IDH1/2 mutations and dysregulated epigenetic programming in leukemia cells. Specifically, our data suggest that DNA hypermethylation is a consequence of mutant IDH protein expression and that IDH1/2-mutant-mediated epigenetic effects contribute to AML pathogenesis. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants ... Consistent with previous findings (Ito et al., 2010 and Tahiliani et al., 2009), cells expressing TET2 showed higher levels of 5-OH-MeC in the nucleus as detected by immunofluorescence staining with 5-OH-MeC-specific antibody. Cotransfection of TET2 with IDH1 R132H, but not wild-type IDH1, reversed this increase in 5-OH-MeC (Figure 5A). To obtain a more quantitative assessment, we also performed flow cytometric analysis of 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Staining with an anti-FLAG antibody allowed us to discriminate between TET2-positive and TET2-negative populations; importantly, the TET2-positive population showed an ∼4-fold increase in the 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Cotransfection with R132H mutant IDH1 led to an ∼40% decrease in the fluorescence intensity, whereas wild-type IDH1 had no significant impact on 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity (Figure 5B). Consistent with its proposed role in DNA demethylation, TET2 transfection also caused a decrease in 5-methylcytosine, which could be reversed by coexpression of IDH1 R132H mutant but not wild-type IDH1 (Figure S5). Together, these data suggest that expression of mutant IDH is able to inhibit the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine by TET2 and subsequent DNA demethylation | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Specifically, we did not identify a single patient with concurrent mutations in TET2 and in IDH1 or IDH2; 0/57 IDH1/2-mutant cases were TET2-mutant versus 28/300 IDH1/2-wild-type AML cases ( Figure 4). These data suggest that TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations form a distinct mutational class in AML, and that IDH1/2 mutations and TET2 mutations have overlapping roles in AML pathogenesis ... The fact that IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations are mutually exclusive in AML and that IDH1/2 mutations induce hypermethylation and inhibit TET2-mediated 5-hydroxymethylation suggested that both mutations may function by altering the cytosine methylation profiles of hematopoietic cells ...

Thus, the expression levels of prosurvival proteins, particularly Mcl-1 and A1, in individual tumors should be valuable prognostic markers for responses to ABT-737. In small-cell lung cancer cell lines, resistance to ABT-737 correlates with elevated Mcl-1 expression (C. Tse, S.K. Tahir, S. Fesik, S. Rosenberg, and S. Elmore, personal communication). Our results also predict that tumors initially sensitive to ABT-737 may eventually become resistant by Mcl-1 upregulation. Indeed, the efficacy of ABT-737 to prolong survival of mice transplanted with a lymphoma is severely compromised if Mcl-1 is overexpressed ( Figure 6) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  E, |

To examine whether they also played unique roles during K-RasG12V-driven NSCLC, we crossed K-Ras+/G12V mice with B-Raflox/lox ( Chen et al., 2006) and c-Raflox/lox ( Jesenberger et al., 2001) animals and submitted them to infection with Ad-Cre particles. As illustrated in Figure 5A, conditional ablation of B-Raflox alleles in K-RasG12V-induced NSCLC did not increase survival (50% survival of K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raflox/lox mice [n = 25] at 41.5 versus 40 weeks in K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raf+/+ control animals [n = 28], a 5% increase). The number and grade of tumors in mice lacking B-Raf 6 months after Ad-Cre treatment were similar to those present in control mice ( Figures 5B and 5C). Efficient recombination of the B-Raflox alleles in tumor tissue was determined by Southern ( Figure S5) and western ( Figure 5D) blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry staining with an anti-B-Raf antibody further confirmed the absence of B-Raf expression in tumor tissue ( Figure 5E). Interestingly, elimination of B-Raf expression had no effect on the levels of Mek and Erk phosphorylation, as determined by either western blot ( Figure 5D) or immunohistochemical ( Figure 5E) analysis. These observations suggest that in the absence of B-Raf, other Raf proteins can maintain mitogenic signaling through the Mek/Erk pathway.

Thus, neither B-Raf nor A-Raf could compensate for the lack of c-Raf. Because K-Ras is the Ras isoform that binds and activates c-Raf more efficiently ( Voice et al., 1999), it is possible that c-Raf might be essential to mediate K-Ras signaling to the Mek and Erk kinases, at least in an oncogenic setting. Indeed, oncogenic RAS exclusively signaled via c-RAF to the ERK-MAPK pathway in human melanoma cell lines ( Dumaz et al., 2006). However, it is also possible that c-Raf, but not B-Raf or A-Raf, may modulate an alternative downstream pathway essential for malignant transformation ( Takezawa et al., 2009), but not for normal homeostasis.

Based on the four peptide sequences obtained from the 53 kDa subunit, a cDNA clone encoding 429 amino acids was isolated. BAF53 shows extensive homology with actin and actin-related proteins Act2 and Act3 ... The following lines of evidence support the conclusion that β-actin and the actin-related protein BAF53 are functional subunits of the BAF complex: (1) they specifically coimmunoprecipitate at physiological concentrations with all available antibodies against BAF subunits even under very stringent conditions; (2) they associate with the complex only in the presence of BRG1; (3) they directly interact with BRG1 in the complex by two independent biochemical criteria; (4) actin can be specifically covalently cross-linked to BRG-1 in living cells using bifunctional cross-linking agents that do not detect interactions mediated by a third protein; and (5) they are required for the maximal ATPase activity of BRG1. Additional support for our conclusion that BAF53 is a functional component of the complex comes from the identification of a yeast homolog | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

In addition to the catalytic Sec7 domain both groups contain a PH domain. The activity of the large ArfGEFs was found to be inhibited by the natural compound Brefeldin A, resulting in the collapse of the Golgi structure. Brefeldin A stabilizes the ternary ARF-GDP-GEF complex and thus traps the GEF in an unproductive complex with its substrate. Structural analysis revealed that Brefeldin A binds at the binding interface between the Sec7 domain and Arf1 and thereby stabilizes the interaction (Renault et al., 2003). An elegant approach to identify inhibitors for GEFs was recently reported for the small ArfGEFs. M69 was identified in a library of RNA aptomers due to its ability to inhibit Cytohesin-1 activity in vitro (Mayer et al., 2001). Subsequently, a chemical library was screened for molecules that could compete with M69 for binding to Cytohesin-1 resulting in identification of SecinH3. SecinH3 inhibited the ARNO and Cytohesin-1 with an IC50 in the low micromolar range in vitro. Interestingly, using this inhibitor it was found that cytohesins play a role in insulin signaling, demonstrating its applicability for in vivo systems (Hafner et al., 2006) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

The G-protein-bound nucleotide is sandwiched between two loops called switch 1 and switch 2. The switch regions together with the phosphate-binding loop (P loop) interact with the phosphates and a coordinating magnesium ion. Both phosphates and the magnesium ion are essential for the high-affinity binding of the nucleotide to the G protein (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001). The action of the GEF on the G protein was analyzed in several structural studies. Due to the inherent instability of the ternary complexes most structural studies have been performed with stable binary complexes between GEFs and G proteins (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998, Worthylake et al., 2000, Renault et al., 2001, Goldberg, 1998 and Itzen et al., 2006). These have revealed that the catalytic domains of the various families of GEFs are structurally unrelated and approach the G proteins from different angles (Figure 2B).

Several elegant studies have illustrated the importance of metabolic transformation in cancer development (Freed-Pastor et al., 2012; Locasale et al., 2011; Schafer et al., 2009; Ying et al., 2012), although there is limited information about how these metabolic changes may impact on tumorigenicity in vivo | Reference Offset:  ['28058-28939', '29631-30542'] | Reference Text:  The reprogramming of cellular metabolism to support continuous proliferation is a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Our analysis in vivo following KrasG12D extinction showed rapid downregulation of specific metabolic enzymes and their pathways prior to any discernible biological impact (e.g., morphological or proliferative changes), a finding consistent with the active control of tumor cell metabolism by KrasG12D. Indeed, the Kras oncogene is known to induce aerobic glycolysis (Racker et al., 1985), and PDAC cells have been shown previously to have metabolism consistent with elevated aerobic glycolysis (Zhou et al., 2011). Interestingly, this metabolic switch may be dependent on cell type or oncogenic Ras isoform as H-Ras transformed mesenchymal stem cells do not depend on increased glycolysis for ATP production during transformation (Funes et al., 2007) ... Our work establishes that KrasG12D extinction leads to inhibition of glucose uptake and a decrease in several glycolytic intermediates, including G6P, F6P, and FBP. Although aerobic glycolysis is recognized as inefficient from a bioenergetics perspective, metabolic reprogramming to a glycolytic state has been proposed as a mechanism which allows the allocation of glycolytic intermediates into biosynthetic pathways (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). Indeed, we have demonstrated the enhanced glycolytic flux is diverted into the nonoxidative PPP to facilitate ribose biogenesis. Furthermore, such hypotheses are also supported by the observation that amplification/overexpression of PHGDH, a rate-limiting enzyme functioning to divert 3-phospho-glycerate (a glycolytic intermediate) into the serine biosynthesis pathway, facilitates tumor growth in certain contexts (Locasale et al., 2011; Possemato et al., 2011) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

These mice were crossed to ROSA26-LSL-rtTA-IRES-GFP (ROSA_rtTA) (Belteki et al., 2005) and p48-Cre (Kawaguchi et al., 2002) mice to enable pancreas-specific and doxycycline (doxy)-inducible expression of KrasG12D (Figure S1B). This triple transgenic strain is designated hereafter as iKras. Doxy treatment effectively induced oncogenic Kras expression and activity (Figures S1C and S1D), but did not substantially increase total Kras expression at the mRNA or protein levels (Figures S1C and S1E). Extinction of the KrasG12D transgene occurs within 24 hr following doxy withdrawal (Figures S1C and S1D) ... Consistent with the role of KrasG12D as a driver of PDAC initiation (Hezel et al., 2006), doxy induction provokes acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and PanIN lesions within 2 weeks (Figure S1F). Similar to the LSL-KrasG12D knock-in model, induction of the KrasG12D transgene leads to infrequent occurrence of invasive PDAC after long latency (35–70 weeks) (Figure S1F), suggesting comparable biological activity of the KrasG12D alleles and the need for additional genetic events for tumor progression. To enable full malignant progression and assess the tumor maintenance role of KrasG12D in advanced malignancies, we crossed iKras and conditional p53 knockout (p53L) alleles (Marino et al., 2000).

As shown in Figure 1C, KrasG12D extinction led to rapid tumor regression with morphological deterioration of tumor cells and rapid degeneration of stromal elements starting 48 hr and peaking at 72 hr following doxy withdrawal. After 1 week of doxy withdrawal, MRI showed a reduction in tumor mass of ~50%, whereas PET/CT showed complete loss of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (Figures 1D and 1E). On the histopathological level, virtually all malignant components of the tumor regressed with the remaining pancreata displaying collagen deposition surrounding few remnant ductal structures (Figure 1C). Correspondingly, tumor regression was accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation (BrdU incorporation) and increased apoptosis (Caspase-3 activation) 2–3 days after doxy withdrawal, culminating in complete loss of tumor cell proliferation at 1 week off doxy (Figures 2A and S2A; data not shown). Moreover, KrasG12D extinction effected dramatic changes in the tumor stroma as evidenced by a reduction in pancreatic stellate cells (marked by SMA staining) (Figure 2A), which is a prominent component of the classical stromal reaction in PDAC. This indicates that oncogenic Kras has significant non-cell-autonomous effects on the stromal compartment.

To explore this possibility, we used 14C1- or 14C6-labeled glucose to track the contribution of oxidative versus nonoxidative PPP into DNA and RNA.

To enable full malignant progression and assess the tumor maintenance role of KrasG12D in advanced malignancies, we crossed iKras and conditional p53 knockout (p53L) alleles (Marino et al., 2000). Following doxy treatment at 3 weeks of age, all iKras p53L/+ mice succumbed to PDAC between 11 and 25 weeks of age (median survival, 15 weeks), whereas the doxy-treated iKras p53L/L mice succumbed to PDAC more rapidly with a median survival of 7.9 weeks (Figure 1A). The iKras p53 mutant tumors exhibited features commonly found in human PDAC, including glandular tumor structures, exuberant stroma, local invasion into surrounding structures such as the duodenum, and distant metastases to the liver and lung (Figure 1B). Histological analysis documented invasive PDAC in 8/8 iKras p53L/+ mice at 8 weeks after induction (Figure S1G). As such, we assessed the impact of KrasG12D extinction on tumor biology and maintenance at 9 weeks after induction.

Through a reiterative process of error minimization, these supervised learning algorithms learn to recognize the optimal gene expression patterns for a specific subtype. Classification was approached using a decision tree format, in which the first decision was T-ALL versus B lineage (non-T-ALL) and then within the B lineage subset, cases were sequentially classified into the known risk groups characterized by the presence of E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL, MLL chimeric genes, and lastly hyperdiploid with >50 chromosomes.

For example, using the three component dimensions that accounted for 72.8% of the variance of gene expression among the subgroups, we were able to separate T-ALL (43 cases), E2A-PBX1 (27 cases), TEL-AML1 (79 cases), and hyperdiploid >50 (64 cases) from the remaining ALL subtypes (114 cases) ...

Moreover, both KG F/+ and KG F/F mice exhibited a significant decrease in tumor number relative to KG +/+ controls, with KG F/F animals exhibiting a more striking decline ( Figure 6C) ... We then monitored animals by micro-CT for 1 month. As seen in Figures 6H and 6I, we found that Gata2 loss had a striking effect, with near-complete abrogation of lung tumors in treated LG F/F mice. Longitudinal analysis of LG +/+ animals revealed a substantial increase in tumor size over time; a more modest increase in LG F/+ mice; and extensive regression in LG F/F mice ( Figure 6J) ... Our investigations revealed a marked attenuation of autochthonous Kras mutant NSCLC growth in response to systemic Gata2 loss; similar effects were observed with whole-body inhibition of the Myc-Max interaction in a related Kras mutant lung tumor model ( Soucek et al., 2008). However, these findings face the issue of translation into clinically relevant therapies, as DNA-binding proteins are traditionally considered undruggable by the pharmaceutical industry ( Darnell, 2002) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Both in vitro and in vivo, loss of GATA2 reduces mutant NSCLC cell line viability. Combined gene expression and chromatin occupancy analysis reveals a broad network of pathways controlled by GATA2 in RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC cells ... Through integrated analyses of gene expression and genome occupancy, we found that this dependency occurs via concurrent regulation of three pathways: the proteasome machinery; the IL-1/NF-κB signaling pathway; and the Rho-signaling cascade ( Figure 5K). These pathways exhibit extensive crosstalk, suggesting the network to be mutually reinforcing ( Figures S6CñS6E) ... Beyond this initial approach, such treatment strategies could be improved further by inhibition of IL-1 signaling with IL-1 receptor monoclonal antibodies (Dinarello, 2010). Moreover, as this approach targets a network, one could envisage a multi-tiered strategy to inhibit various points within the signaling pathways. For example, along with fasudil one could inhibit Rho signaling upstream at the ephrin receptor with dasatinib (Montero et al., 2011) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

To examine combined inhibition of these pathways on KRAS mutant NSCLC, we first treated a subset of KRAS mutant and WT cells with the individual drugs and their combination.

A number of studies have identified unbiased strategies to treat KRAS mutant cancers through RNA interference screens, including inhibition of TAK1, STK33, TBK1, WT1, GATA2, and BCL-XL/MEK [28], [29], [30], [31], [32] and [33] | Reference Offset:  ['6617-7115', '12847-13146', '13549-14017'] | Reference Text:  Furthermore, Gata2 is required for Kras mutant tumorigenesis in an autochthonous mouse model, and whole-organism loss of Gata2 induces regression of established Kras mutant lung tumors without drastic toxicities. Finally, combined inhibition of GATA2-regulated pathways with clinically available inhibitors recapitulates the effect of GATA2 loss, causing a robust suppression of established Kras mutant NSCLC and providing an immediately applicable therapeutic strategy for RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC ... To address this, we used small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against both KRAS and GATA2 in the NSCLC cell lines A549 (KRAS mutant), PC9 (EGFR mutant), and H322M (WT). As expected, A549 cells exhibited reduced viability with loss of either KRAS or GATA2, whereas H322M cells were unaffected ( Figure 1B) ... To further validate GATA2, we designed shRNAs against GATA2. To this end, one shRNA (shGATA2.1) achieved substantial knockdown of GATA2 in A549 and PC9 cells relative to a control (shGAPDH) and a nonfunctional GATA2 shRNA (shGATA2.2) (Figure 1C). Notably, shGATA2.1-expressing A549 and PC9 cells had greatly reduced viability relative to the other shRNAs but did not affect WT H322M cells (Figure 1D). Hereafter, shGATA2.1 is referred to as ìshGî and shGAPDH as ìshC.î | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  H, |

However, these findings face the issue of translation into clinically relevant therapies, as DNA-binding proteins are traditionally considered undruggable by the pharmaceutical industry ( Darnell, 2002) ... Consequently, we combined inhibition of the proteasome and Rho/ROCK signaling with the clinical compounds bortezomib and fasudil, respectively. Considering the dramatic effects observed with this regimen, we believe such a strategy may benefit patients with RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  H, |

Through integrated analyses of gene expression and genome occupancy, we defined a GATA2 network of signaling pathways that present discrete avenues of therapeutic targeting. Consequently, we combined inhibition of the proteasome and Rho/ROCK signaling with the clinical compounds bortezomib and fasudil, respectively.
