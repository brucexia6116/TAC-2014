Using quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, we observed a 2-fold effect on LATS2 RNA levels and 4- to 5-fold on protein levels by the miR-371-3 cluster (Figure 5C). As a control, we used a LATS2 knockdown construct (Figure 5F). These results show that a combined effect of RNA destruction and translation inhibition is used by miR-372&3 to silence LATS2. miR-372/3 was predicted to bind two sites in the 3′UTR of LATS2 that are highly conserved between human, mouse, and zebrafish (Figure 5D). To further substantiate LATS2 as a direct target of miR372&3, we cloned its 3′UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-LATS2). We transfected either pGL3-LATS2 or the controls pGL3-372 and pGL3-373 (containing a miR-complementary sequence in their 3′UTR) or pGL3 into Tera1 and MCF-7 cells (respectively positive and negative for miR-371-3) ( Figures 4D and S6). As predicted, the 372/373 complementary sequences mediated strong inhibition of luciferase expression in Tera1 cells. Significantly, a potent inhibition of luciferase activity was also mediated by the 3′UTR of LATS2 in either MCF-7 ectopically expressing miR-372 or in Tera1 cells but not by a construct mutated at both miR-372-predicted target sites ... Next, we tested whether LATS2 is a functional target of miR-372&3 using a YFP-competition assay. Indeed, inhibition of LATS2 conferred a growth advantage to cells expressing RASV12 (Figure 5F). The overall effect was less than the effect of the miR-Vec 373 but comparable to loss of p53. Therefore, these results point to LATS2 as a mediator of the miR-372 and miR-373 effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, although they do not exclude the participation of other direct miR-targets, such as Suv39-H1, in these processes | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B |

In this context, while the development of TGCTs would be allowed by a partial functional inactivation of p53 (see [53], [54]), such mechanism would be insufficient to counteract the pro-apoptotic function of p53 induced by a persistent damage, causing a rapid cell death | Reference Offset: ['21571-22172', '26352-26530'] | Reference Text:  Since cells expressing miR-372&3 proliferate in the presence of increased p21cip1 levels, we examined their response to damaged DNA. In the presence of both miRNAs, and irrespective of RASV12 expression, IR induced a cell cycle arrest that was indistinguishable from control cells, whereas the suppression of p53 expression allowed, as expected, continuous DNA replication (Figure 4C and data not shown). These results indicate that although miR-372&3 confer complete protection to oncogene-induced senescence in a manner similar to p53 inactivation, the cellular response to DNA damage remains intact ...

Transfection of synthetic siRNA only evokes transient gene silencing often accompanied with non-specific or toxic effects, and many types of mammalian cells are ineffective or resistant to the transfection [7]. Lentiviral vector delivery of RNAi possesses great advantages over raw siRNA applications owing to their wide-range tropism, genomic integration property and effective in vitro delivery |

Here, we present several lines of evidence that REST may play a role in tumor suppression in humans. First, reduced REST function (mediated by RNAi or expression of dominant-negative REST) promotes transformation of human epithelial cells. Conversely, reconstitution of REST expression elicits a dramatic proliferation defect in colon cancer cells that have lost endogenous REST function. Strikingly, an independent aCGH-based search for genomic loci characterized by recurrent microdeletions identified the REST locus as a high-confidence target in colorectal cancer. This high-confidence list includes two previously established tumor suppressors, p16INK4A and TGFβRII (Derynck et al., 2001, Ruas and Peters, 1998 and Siegel and Massague, 2003), the latter of which was also identified as a SECT gene. In addition, larger deletions encompassing the REST gene were frequent in colon tumors and tumor cell lines. Furthermore, we isolated a frameshift mutation of the REST coding region in colorectal tumor cells that displays properties of a dominant negative, transforming human epithelial cells to a level similar to REST shRNAs.

First, reduced REST function (mediated by RNAi or expression of dominant-negative REST) promotes transformation of human epithelial cells. Conversely, reconstitution of REST expression elicits a dramatic proliferation defect in colon cancer cells that have lost endogenous REST function. Strikingly, an independent aCGH-based search for genomic loci characterized by recurrent microdeletions identified the REST locus as a high-confidence target in colorectal cancer.

Intriguingly, a variety of human tumors including those arising in breast, ovary, and lung activate expression of neuron-specific genes. In some instances, the inappropriate expression of these neural genes elicits an autoimmune response that culminates in neurological disorders, collectively known as paraneoplastic neurologic degenerations (PND; see Discussion) ( Albert and Darnell, 2004). Such aberrant neural gene expression suggests that these cancers harbor defects in regulators of neuronal programs. Consequently, we investigated a potential role for REST in human tumor suppression ... REST is widely expressed throughout nonneuronal tissues including the colonic epithelium (Figure S1) (Chong et al., 1995 and Schoenherr and Anderson, 1995). The above results suggest that loss of REST expression may confer a selective advantage during the evolution of tumor cells. This hypothesis predicts that cells with defective REST function may be sensitive to reconstitution of REST. We examined this prediction by ectopically expressing REST in colon cancer cells that have lost (SW1417) or retain (SW620) endogenous REST expression (Figure 4A). Exogenous REST expression elicited a mild decrease in the proliferation of SW620 colon cancer cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, ectopic REST expression significantly reduced colony formation in SW1417 cells (>50-fold; Figure 4B), indicating that these cells are highly dependent on the absence of REST for their proliferation in vitro. Coupled with the function of REST in suppressing epithelial cell transformation (Figure 1E), these data strongly support a role for REST in tumor suppression | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  E, |

For example, the joint expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT), oncogenic H-RASV12, and SV40-small t antigen combined with the suppression of p53 and p16INK4A were sufficient to render primary human fibroblasts tumorigenic (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).

These experimental models have been useful in delineating the minimum genetic perturbations required for transformation of various human cell types as well as evaluating the functional cooperation between a gene of interest and a defined genetic context. To date, these models of human cell transformation have incorporated genes already implicated in human tumorigenesis.

Cells transduced with H-ras V12 or with empty vector were plated at low density and cell numbers were counted ( Figure 2B; data not shown for WI38 cells) ... Twenty-five thousand cells per well were plated into 12-well plates. At the indicated times, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 10% formalin, and rinsed with distilled water. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) for 30 min, rinsed extensively, and dried. Cell-associated dye was extracted with 2.0 ml 10% acetic acid. Aliquots were diluted 1:4 with H2O, transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, and the optical density at 590 nm was determined. Values were normalized to the optical density at day 0 for the appropriate cell type. Within an experiment, each point was determined in triplicate; each growth curve was performed at least twice | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

For example, senescent cells adopt a flat enlarged morphology and cease proliferation at subconfluent densities despite the presence of serum (reviewed by 63 and 69). Also, senescent cells arrest with a G1 DNA content, and express increased levels and/or activity of p53, p21, and p16 ( 49, 3, 2, 20 and 52).

This Ras-induced senescence is also accompanied by p53 induction as well as a rise in ROS levels | Reference Offset:  ['1548-2139', '4638-5144'] | Reference Text:  Oncogenic ras efficiently transforms most immortal rodent cell lines but fails to transform primary cells ( Newbold and Overell 1983). ras cooperates, however, with certain other oncogenic alterations to transform primary rodent cells ( 35 and 56), including overexpression of c-Myc, dominant negative p53, D-type cyclins, and Cdc25A and -B, and loss of p53, p16, or IRF-1 (reviewed by 70 and 57; see also Hinds et al. 1994; 38, 66, 17 and 60). Several viral oncoproteins also cooperate with ras, including SV40 T-antigen, adenovirus E1A, human papillomavirus E7, and HTLV-1 Tax ( 70 and 57) ... Primary murine fibroblasts lacking either p53 or p16 are transformed by oncogenic ras alone ( 66 and 60) and are easily established into immortal cell lines ( 22, 45 and 60). In human cells, inactivation of p53 and/or p16 also facilitates the immortalization process ( Reznikoff et al. 1996; Rogan et al. 1996).

Ionizing radiation was shown to activate the APC/C to degrade cyclin D1, which triggers an immediate p53-independent G1 arrest [9] | Reference Offset:  ['33197-33700', '39471-39779', '40759-41113'] | Reference Text:  Genotoxic stresses, such as IR, induce a fast and strong G1 arrest that is sustained over a prolonged period of time. We report here that this type of G1 arrest builds up in two different and mechanistically distinct phases: initiation and maintenance. The initial process is fast (accomplished in a period of less than 10 hr), strong (more than 15% increase in G1 in an asynchronous population), and is mediated by cyclin D1 degradation. p53 activity is dispensable for G1 arrest in this initial period ... We demonstrate here that cyclin D1 has a functional RxxL motif, also known as a destruction box, within its amino terminus. This destruction box does not play a role in the normal metabolic turn-over of cyclin D1 protein (Figure 4), but mediates rapid cyclin D1 degradation after exposure to genotoxic stress ... In support of this view is our finding that the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex specifically associates with the APC in cycling cells (Figure 5). Whereas the interaction of APC with CDK4 remains intact in cells exposed to IR, the interaction with cyclin D1 decreases rapidly. Therefore, it seems that CDK4 serves as a bridging factor between cyclin D1 and the APC | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Alternatively, the anaphase promoting complex (APC) is responsible for the rapid degradation of cyclin D1 in cells irradiated with ionizing radiation [31] | Reference Offset:  ['19714-20667'] | Reference Text:  Since cyclin D1 harbors a destruction box–like motif, we searched for an association of endogenous cyclin D1/CDK4 complexes with Cdc27, a conserved component of the APC (King et al. 1995). In nontransfected MCF-7 cells, we clearly and specifically detect both endogenous CDK4 and cyclin D1 proteins in Cdc27 immunoprecipitates (Figure 5A). Conversely, Cdc27 was present in cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates (Figure 5B). Moreover, Cdc27 was present in anti-CDK4 but not anti-CDK2 immunoprecipitates (Figure 5C). Significantly, the interaction between CDK4 and Cdc27 was not affected by IR (Figure 5C), whereas the amount of Cdc27 bound to cyclin D1 decreased, most likely due to degradation of cyclin D1 by IR (Figure 5B, compare upper and middle panels). These results suggest that the APC is constitutively associated with the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex and are consistent with a model in which the APC is responsible for cyclin D1 proteolysis in response to IR | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

However, as observed in the present study, threonine 286 phosphorylation is essential for proteolytic degradation of cyclin D1 in skin | Reference Offset:  ['15076-15311', '17568-18200', '39471-39779'] | Reference Text:  Furthermore, a mutant of cyclin D1 in which the GSK3-β phosphorylation site was mutated (T286A), and is completely refractory to GSK3-β induced degradation (Diehl et al. 1998), was fully responsive to IR-induced degradation (Figure 4B) ... However, two independent point mutations within the putative destruction box of cyclin D1 (either R29Q or L32A) completely abolished degradation by IR ( Figure 4B). Combining each of these mutations in the destruction box with a mutation in the GSK3-β phosphorylation site ( Figure 4B, R29Q;T286A and L32A;T286A mutants) gave rise to a higher level of protein expression in nonirradiated cells that was fully resistant to the IR effect, in sharp contrast to the T286A single mutant ( Figure 4B). These data suggest that the RxxL destruction box in cyclin D1 is the major motif that renders cyclin D1 susceptible to degradation by IR ... We demonstrate here that cyclin D1 has a functional RxxL motif, also known as a destruction box, within its amino terminus.

Combining each of these mutations in the destruction box with a mutation in the GSK3-β phosphorylation site ( Figure 4B, R29Q;T286A and L32A;T286A mutants) gave rise to a higher level of protein expression in nonirradiated cells that was fully resistant to the IR effect, in sharp contrast to the T286A single mutant ( Figure 4B). These data suggest that the RxxL destruction box in cyclin D1 is the major motif that renders cyclin D1 susceptible to degradation by IR ... Our identification of the RxxL destruction motif as a necessary element for cyclin D1 degradation points to the involvement of APC in this process. In support of this view is our finding that the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex specifically associates with the APC in cycling cells (Figure 5). Whereas the interaction of APC with CDK4 remains intact in cells exposed to IR, the interaction with cyclin D1 decreases rapidly. Therefore, it seems that CDK4 serves as a bridging factor between cyclin D1 and the APC | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

DNA damage checkpoints control the timing of cell cycle progression in response to genotoxic stress (reviewed in Weinert 1998). Arrest in G1 is thought to prevent aberrant replication of damaged DNA and arrest in G2 allows cells to avoid segregation of defective chromosomes. Primary among mammalian checkpoint genes is the tumor suppressor p53. In response to DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation (IR), p53 is required for G1 arrest (reviewed in Lakin and Jackson 1999), apoptosis (reviewed in Sionov and Haupt 1999), and to sustain arrest of cells prior to M phase (Bunz et al. 1998) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

In fact, genotoxic stresses such as ionizing radiation have been demonstrated to trigger rapid proteolysis of cyclin D1, leading to p53-independent G1 arrest (25). This is in accordance with our .nding that treatment of p53-deficient cells with adriamycin caused a signi.cant decrease in cyclin D1 protein stability (Fig. 2) | Reference Offset:  ['33197-33700', '34523-35044'] | Reference Text:  Genotoxic stresses, such as IR, induce a fast and strong G1 arrest that is sustained over a prolonged period of time. We report here that this type of G1 arrest builds up in two different and mechanistically distinct phases: initiation and maintenance. The initial process is fast (accomplished in a period of less than 10 hr), strong (more than 15% increase in G1 in an asynchronous population), and is mediated by cyclin D1 degradation. p53 activity is dispensable for G1 arrest in this initial period ... This p53 response depends on several time-consuming processes and is therefore inherently slow. Therefore, the p53 response appears more suited to maintain and further strengthen an already established G1 arrest, rather than to initiate it. This notion is supported by the present data, which show that p53 hardly contributes to G1 arrest in the first 10 hr after exposure to IR. Our results suggest strongly that the initial phase of G1 arrest following IR relies primarily on downregulation of cyclin D1 protein levels | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

The Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), a multimeric ubiquitin ligase complex of 1.5 MDa, is essential for destruction box-mediated degradation of mitotic cyclins (11 and 15) ... Our identification of the RxxL destruction motif as a necessary element for cyclin D1 degradation points to the involvement of APC in this process | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

Within normal tissue, cells are largely instructed to grow by their neighbors (paracrine signals) or via systemic (endocrine) signals. Cell-to-cell growth signaling is likely to operate in the vast majority of human tumors as well; virtually all are composed of several distinct cell types that appear to communicate via heterotypic signaling ... Heterotypic signaling between the diverse cell types within a tumor may ultimately prove to be as important in explaining tumor cell proliferation as the cancer cell-autonomous mechanisms enumerated above. For example, we suspect that many of the growth signals driving the proliferation of carcinoma cells originate from the stromal cell components of the tumor mass. While difficult to validate at present, such thinking recasts the logic of acquired GS autonomy: successful tumor cells are those that have acquired the ability to co-opt their normal neighbors by inducing them to release abundant fluxes of growth-stimulating signals (Skobe and Fusenig 1998). Indeed, in some tumors, these cooperating cells may eventually depart from normalcy, coevolving with their malignant neighbors in order to sustain the growth of the latter (58 and 72). Further, inflammatory cells attracted to sites of neoplasia may promote (rather than eliminate) cancer cells (18, 22 and 46), another example of normal cells conscripted to enhance tumor growth potential, another means to acquire necessary capabilities ... cancer development depends upon changes in the heterotypic interactions between incipient tumor cells and their normal neighbors. Moreover, once formed, virtually all types of human tumors, including their metastatic outgrowths, continue to harbor complex mixtures of several cell types that collaborate to create malignant growth (Figure 3) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Accordingly, successful colonization of these new sites (both local and distant) demands adaptation ... The activation of extracellular proteases and the altered binding specificities of cadherins, CAMs, and integrins are clearly central to the acquisition of invasiveness and metastatic ability. But the regulatory circuits and molecular mechanisms that govern these shifts remain elusive and, at present, seem to differ from one tissue environment to another. The acquired capability for invasion and metastasis represents the last great frontier for exploratory cancer research ... cancer development depends upon changes in the heterotypic interactions between incipient tumor cells and their normal neighbors. Moreover, once formed, virtually all types of human tumors, including their metastatic outgrowths, continue to harbor complex mixtures of several cell types that collaborate to create malignant growth (Figure 3).

Within normal tissue, cells are largely instructed to grow by their neighbors (paracrine signals) or via systemic (endocrine) signals. Cell-to-cell growth signaling is likely to operate in the vast majority of human tumors as well; virtually all are composed of several distinct cell types that appear to communicate via heterotypic signaling ... cancer development depends upon changes in the heterotypic interactions between incipient tumor cells and their normal neighbors.

The paths that cells take on their way to becoming malignant are highly variable. Within a given cancer type, mutation of particular target genes such as ras or p53 may be found in only a subset of otherwise histologically identical tumors. Further, mutations in certain oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can occur early in some tumor progression pathways and late in others. As a consequence, the acquisition of biological capabilities such as resistance to apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis, and unlimited replicative potential can appear at different times during these various progressions. Accordingly, the particular sequence in which capabilities are acquired can vary widely, both among tumors of the same type and certainly between tumors of different types ( Figure 4). Furthermore, in certain tumors, a specific genetic event may, on its own, contribute only partially to the acquisition of a single capability, while in others, this event may aid in the simultaneous acquisition of several distinct capabilities.

Indeed, in some tumors, these cooperating cells may eventually depart from normalcy, coevolving with their malignant neighbors in order to sustain the growth of the latter (58 and 72).

When coexpressed with a myc oncogene in transgenic mice, the bcl-2 gene was able to promote formation of B cell lymphomas by enhancing lymphocyte survival, not by further stimulating their myc-induced proliferation ( Strasser et al. 1990); further, 50% of the infrequent lymphomas arising in bcl-2 single transgenic transgenic mice had somatic translocations activating c-myc, confirming a selective pressure during lymphomagenesis to upregulate both Bcl-2 and c-Myc ( McDonnell and Korsmeyer 1991) ...

The ability of tumor cell populations to expand in number is determined not only by the rate of cell proliferation but also by the rate of cell attrition. Programmed cell death—apoptosis—represents a major source of this attrition.

We suspect that growth signaling pathways suffer deregulation in all human tumors. Although this point is hard to prove rigorously at present, the clues are abundant (Hunter 1997). For example, in the best studied of tumors—human colon carcinomas—about half of the tumors bear mutant ras oncogenes ( Kinzler and Vogelstein 1996) ... Heterotypic signaling between the diverse cell types within a tumor may ultimately prove to be as important in explaining tumor cell proliferation as the cancer cell-autonomous mechanisms enumerated above. For example, we suspect that many of the growth signals driving the proliferation of carcinoma cells originate from the stromal cell components of the tumor mass.

We identified a centrosomal kinase, Aurora-A, as one of the candidate kinases for phosphorylation of S83 residue on Lats2 ... Immunostaining data with the anti-phosphorylated S83 antibody reveals that S83 on Lats2 is phosphorylated in vivo during the cell cycle and it is more prominent during prophase and metaphase than interphase, anapahse and telophase, which is similar to the expression pattern of Aurora-A during the cell cycle (Fig. 4A and Bischoff et al. 1998).

Therefore, it was important to ensure that the shuffled miRNA controls matched the corresponding miRNAs closely in all sequence properties that impact the expected number and quality of TargetScan target sites. The properties we considered were (1) the expected frequency of seed matches in the UTR dataset; (2) the expected frequency of matching to the 3′ end of the miRNA; (3) the observed count of seed matches in the UTR dataset; and (4) the predicted free energy of a seed:seed match duplex. A miRNA shuffling protocol, MiRshuffle, was developed to generate randomized control sequences that possess all of these properties.

The importance of complementarity to the 5′ portion of invertebrate miRNAs has been suspected since the observation that complementary sites within the lin-14 mRNA have “core elements” of complementarity to the 5′ segment of the lin-4 miRNA (Wightman et al., 1993) and has been corroborated with the observation that the 5′ segments of numerous invertebrate miRNAs are perfectly complementary to 3′ UTR elements that mediate posttranscriptional regulation or are known miRNA targets Lai 2002 and Stark et al. 2003. Moreover, the 5′ ends of related miRNAs tend to be better conserved than the 3′ ends (Lim et al., 2003b), further supporting the hypothesis that these segments are most critical for mRNA recognition. To explore this hypothesis, TargetScan was applied to predict targets of the nrVert miRNA set conserved between human, mouse, and rat using versions of the algorithm differing in the miRNA heptamer defined as the seed in step 1 (Figure 2B). Consistent with residues at the 5′ end of miRNAs being most important for target recognition, the highest signal:noise ratio was observed when the seed was positioned at or near the extreme 5′ end of the miRNA, with signal:noise values of 2.7, 3.4, and 1.6 observed for seeds at segments 1..7, 2..8, and 3..9, respectively, and signal:noise ratios of 1.3 or less at other seed positions. We suggest that the critical importance of pairing to segment 2..8 for target identification in silico reflects its importance for target recognition in vivo and speculate that this segment nucleates pairing between miRNAs and mRNAs | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

A miRNA shuffling protocol, MiRshuffle, was developed to generate randomized control sequences that possess all of these properties.

The MiRshuffle procedure calculated expected frequencies using a first-order Markov model of 3' UTR composition that accounts for the long-recognized impact of dinucleotide frequency biases on the counts of longer oligonucleotides (Nussinov, 1981). As an additional control, another shuffling protocol was developed, DiMiRshuffle, which preserves the precise dinucleotide composition of both the seed and the 3' end of the miRNA, as well as the seed match count and seed:seed match folding free energy ...

The higher signal seen for the more broadly conserved miRNAs can be explained by the idea that miRNAs with larger numbers of targets would be under greater selective constraint, and therefore less likely to change during the course of evolution. Thus, more broadly conserved miRNAs would be likely to have more targets and consequently a higher TargetScan signal. This observation again supports the conclusion that TargetScan is detecting authentic targets because otherwise it would be difficult to explain the observed difference in signal:noise for broadly conserved miRNAs relative to that of less broadly conserved miRNAs | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Conversely, enforced expression of a cyclin D1 transgene in the breast tissue of mice predisposes to mammary cancer ( Wang et al., 1994). Moreover, whereas mice overexpressing Her2/Neu or oncogenic Ras transgenes targeted to mammary epithelium rapidly develop breast cancer, they fail to do so in a cyclin D1 null background, indicating that D1 function is essential for tumorigenesis and that other D-type cyclins in breast tissue cannot compensate ( Yu et al., 2001) ... Susceptibility to familial melanoma was mapped to the INK4a-ARF locus, and the critical mutations in some kindreds affect p16INK4a but not p14ARF function ( Kamb et al., 1994). However, mice lacking Ink4a-Arf rarely develop melanoma unless crossed with animals that express a Ras transgene in appropriate target cells ( Chin et al., 1997 and Bardeesy et al., 2001). When animals containing a mutant Ink4a allele were crossed with mice lacking the entire Ink4a-Arf locus, heterozygotes spontaneously developed melanomas, and dimethylbenzanthrene treatment resulted in a higher frequency of aggressive tumors ( Krimpenfort et al., 2001). Thus, a subtle constellation of genetic events involving p16Ink4a inactivation and Arf haploinsufficiency programs a different outcome than complete loss of Ink4a-Arf, which predisposes to other tumor types ( Serrano et al., 1996) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator: C, |

Arf deficiency partially protects cells from apoptosis induced by these proteins. However, in mouse tumor models lacking functional RB or overexpressing E2F, Arf loss does not invariably diminish apoptosis or accelerate tumorigenesis ( Russell et al., 2002, Tolbert et al., 2002 and Tsai et al., 2002), indicating that E2F can activate p53 through Arf-independent pathways ... A mutant form of E2F (E2F-DB) that binds to DNA but neither interacts with Rb nor transactivates E2F target genes can displace Rb-E2F complexes from promoters. When this mutant was overexpressed in primary MEFs, disruption of Rb-E2F-mediated repression increased the expression of E2F target genes, including Arf ( Rowland et al., 2002). Despite the activation of a persistent p19Arf-mediated p53 response, cells expressing E2F-DB were immortal and resistant to ectopic overexpression of either p19Arf or p53. Therefore, Rb (family)-E2F-mediated repression is required for cell cycle exit in response to p19Arf-p53 activation ... An adenovirus expressing a mutant form of E1A that cannot bind RB should replicate selectively and kill cells lacking functional RB ( Fueyo et al., 2000). A variant in which both the viral E4 and mutant E1A genes are placed under the control of the human E2F1 promoter selectively kills tumor cells with deregulated E2F, whereas normal cells halt viral replication in an RB-dependent manner ( Johnson et al., 2002).

We next investigated whether C/EBPα physically interacts with the miR-223 promoter and whether its binding correlates with miR-223 transcriptional upregulation. This association was analyzed in vivo during RA-induced granulopoiesis of NB4 and RA-resistant NB4 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (Figure 3). Cells were treated with RA for 4, 24, 48, and 72 hr, and chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with an anti-C/EBPα antibody. DNA from the immunoprecipitates was then amplified by PCR using primers (Oligos#1) located in the promoter region close to the putative C/EBPα binding sites (see schematic representation in Figure 3). C/EBPα was found associated with this region after 24, 48, and 72 hr of RA induction in NB4 cells (lanes NB4 24, 48, and 72), whereas no reactivity was measurable in untreated cells (lane 0) or after 4 hr of RA treatment (lane 4).

Indeed, NFI-A was shown to interact with this sequence in vivo; nevertheless, its binding was released upon RA treatment and substituted by that of C/EBPα. This displacement correlated with miRNA transcriptional upregulation. Notably, in cells resistant to retinoic acid and unable to undergo differentiation, the NFI-A factor remained on the miRNA promoter and no C/EBPα binding was detected.

Interestingly, ectopic expression of miR-181 in mouse hematopoietic precursor cells was shown to lead to an increased fraction of B lineage cells (Chen et al., 2004) ... The majority of the CD34α cells are represented by myeloid cells (60%ñ75% of total nucleated cells) at different stages of neutrophilic differentiation, with a ratio of 3:1 to erythroid cells.

The two factors compete for binding to the miR-223 promoter: NFI-A maintains miR-223 at low levels, whereas its replacement by C/EBPα, following retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation, upregulates miR-223 expression. The competition by C/EBPα and the granulocytic differentiation are favored by a negative-feedback loop in which miR-223 represses NFI-A translation. In line with this, both RNAi against NFI-A and ectopic expression of miR-223 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells enhance differentiation, whereas miR-223 knockdown inhibits the differentiation response to RA. Altogether, our data indicate that miR-223 plays a crucial role during granulopoiesis and point to the NFI-A repression as an important molecular pathway mediating gene reprogramming in this cell lineage ... One of the two C/EBPα binding elements in the miR-223 promoter overlaps with a NFI-A binding site (Meisterernst et al., 1988, Bachurski et al., 1997 and Gronostajski, 2000). Indeed, NFI-A was shown to interact with this sequence in vivo; nevertheless, its binding was released upon RA treatment and substituted by that of C/EBPα. This displacement correlated with miRNA transcriptional upregulation. Notably, in cells resistant to retinoic acid and unable to undergo differentiation, the NFI-A factor remained on the miRNA promoter and no C/EBPα binding was detected. These findings supported the hypothesis of a competition between the two proteins in the regulation of the miRNA promoter: NFI-A produces low levels of miR-223, while C/EBPα is the differentiation-specific activator ... RNAi against NFI-A drastically increased the differentiation response of NB4 cells to RA, whereas the opposite effect was found with C/EBPα depletion. These findings are in agreement with the roles described for NFI-A and C/EBPα. C/EBPα has been implicated in promoting differentiation and repressing genes that play the important function of promoting growth (McKnight, 2001 and Tenen, 2001).

These findings supported the hypothesis of a competition between the two proteins in the regulation of the miRNA promoter: NFI-A produces low levels of miR-223, while C/EBPα is the differentiation-specific activator | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  I, |

Study of miR-223 expression disclosed a very interesting regulatory loop involving two well-known transcriptional factors, C/EBPα and NFI-A (see model in Figure 7) ... It is also interesting to note that the fine tuning of miR-223 expression is part of an autoregulatory loop in which translational repression of the miRNA target allows the establishment of miRNA sustained expression | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  I, |

A variety of studies in different experimental systems have provided compelling evidence indicating a very important role of C/EBPα in both growth arrest and terminal differentiation, in particular of granulocytes (Nerlov et al., 1998, Radomska et al., 1998, Wang et al., 1999 and Khanna-Gupta et al., 2001). Although C/EBPα was known to induce granulopoiesis while suppressing monocyte differentiation, it was unclear how C/EBPα regulated this cell fate choice at the mechanistic level ... Besides their effect on miR-223, the knockdown of both transcriptional factors had interesting consequences on differentiation ... On the other hand, NFI-A has been implicated in replication as well as in controlling changes in cell growth (Gronostajski, 2000) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  I, |

To test this hypothesis, we infected wild type and RIP3-/- mice with VV. Consistent with its innate immune protective role, TNF expression was detected in peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) 24 hours post-infection (Fig. 7A). Moreover, TNF expression was induced in the liver and spleen of infected wild type and RIP3-/- mice (Fig. 7B). Thus, virus-induced TNF expression was not impaired in the RIP3-/- mice ... An important role for RIP1/RIP3-mediated programmed necrosis in anti-viral responses is further bolstered by our previous discovery of certain viral FLIPs that potently inhibit programmed necrosis (Chan et al., 2003). More recently, the M45 viral cell death inhibitor from murine cytomegalovirus was shown to interact with RIP1 and RIP3 via the RHIM (Upton et al., 2008).

We show that RIP3 acts upstream to phosphorylate RIP1, which in turn mediates downstream RIP3 phosphorylation. Both RIP3 and the kinase activity of RIP1 are essential for stable formation of the RIP1-RIP3 pro-necrotic complex, which critically controls downstream reactive oxygen species (ROS) production ... Because RIP1 is recruited to both Complex I and Complex II, we examined RIP3 recruitment to these signaling complexes. In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, TNF triggers both apoptosis and programmed necrosis, although apoptosis predominates due to its faster kinetics unless caspases are inhibited (Zheng et al., 2006). In TNFR-2+ Jurkat 4E3 cells, RIP3 was recruited to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E), but not to TNFR-1 associated Complex I (Fig. 2F). On short exposure, zVAD-fmk moderately enhanced RIP1 and RIP3 binding to caspase-8-associated Complex II (Fig. 2E). However, the difference was minor and not distinguishable on longer exposure (Fig. S3). On longer exposure, RIP1 cleavage in Complex II was also visible (Fig. S3). Although RIP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D324 might inactivate the RIP1 kinase function and contribute to the bifurcation of apoptosis and programmed necrosis (Lin et al., 1999), zVAD-fmk likely sensitizes cells to programmed necrosis via additional regulatory events because full length RIP1 was still readily detected without caspase inhibition (Fig. S3) ... One physiological situation in which caspases are inhibited and programmed necrosis might be important is during viral infections (Benedict et al., 2002). To test this hypothesis, we examined cell death responses in activated wild type and RIP3-/- T-cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV), which encodes the viral caspase inhibitor B13R/Spi2. VV-infected cells were resistant to death receptor-induced apoptosis but become sensitized to TNF-induced necrosis (Li and Beg, 2000). Wild type T-cells infected with recombinant GFP-VV exhibited normal T-cell activation-induced cell death (AICD) induced by anti-CD3 antibody (Fig. 6A, compare the white bars). In contrast, AICD in GFP-VV infected RIP3-/- T-cells was significantly reduced compared with uninfected GFP- cells in the same culture (Fig. 6A, compare the black bars). VV-infected RIP3-/- cells were also protected from TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 6B, black bars). In fact, TNF stimulated the proliferation of GFP+ VV-infected RIP3-/- cells, which accounted for the negative cell loss. VV-infected wild type T-cells also exhibited a modest decrease in TNF-induced cell death due to the inhibition of caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 6B, white bars) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

RIP3 regulates necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of RIP1 and RIP3 stabilizes their association within the pro-necrotic complex, activates the pro-necrotic kinase activity, and triggers downstream reactive oxygen species production. The pro-necrotic RIP1-RIP3 complex is induced during vaccinia virus infection. Consequently, RIP3-/- mice exhibited severely impaired virus-induced tissue necrosis, inflammation, and control of viral replication. Thus, RIP3 controls programmed necrosis by initiating the pro-necrotic kinase cascade that is essential for the innate inflammatory response against virus infections ... To further define the molecular regulation of programmed necrosis, we examined the recruitment of RIP1 and RIP3 to Complex II in MEFs because the role of RIP3 in the assembly of the pro-necrotic complex could be evaluated using RIP3-/- MEFs. Similar to Jurkat cells, constitutive association between RIP3 and FADD was also detected in MEFs (Fig. 4A). When programmed necrosis was induced in wild type MEFs with TNF, cycloheximide and zVAD-fmk (T/C/Z) (Fig. S5), RIP1 was recruited to FADD in a TNF-dependent manner (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Moreover, TNF treatment led to further recruitment of RIP3 to the FADD-associated Complex II and RIP3 modification that resembles polyubiquitination (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Strikingly, RIP1 recruitment to Complex II was severely impaired in RIP3-/- MEFs (Fig. 4A, lanes 5-8). The RIP1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) (Degterev et al., 2008) also abolished RIP1 recruitment to FADD and inhibited additional RIP3 binding to the complex (Fig. 4A, lane 4 and Fig. S6). These results indicate that both RIP1 and RIP3 are critical for the assembly of the pro-necrotic Complex II ... Although RIP3 was not identified as a necrosis mediator in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen (Hitomi et al., 2008), we show that formation of a unique pro-necrotic Complex II composed of RIP1 and RIP3 is a crucial first step in the induction of programmed necrosis. RIP3 acts upstream to regulate necrosis-specific RIP1 phosphorylation. However, since the level of RIP1 phosphorylation by ectopically expressed RIP3 was low, it remains possible that RIP3 may activate another kinase that directly phosphorylates RIP1.

(2005) | Citation Offset:  6288-7456 | Citation Text:  Kolfschoten et al. (2005) identified a number of genes in their screen, a couple of which had previously been implicated as possible tumor suppressors. They concentrated, however, on the homeodomain transcription factor PITX1. Knockdown of this gene allows fibroblasts to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. The mechanism appears to involve constitutive activation of the Ras signaling pathways at the level of GTP loading onto Ras itself, suggesting that PITX1 might control the expression of one of the negative regulators of Ras of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. An analysis of the sequences of the promoters of the eight human genes encoding Ras GAPs led them to concentrate on RASAL1, a calcium-sensitive member of the family (Walker et al., 2004). PITX1 directly controls the expression of RASAL1, with the reduction in GAP activity when PITX1 and consequently RASAL1 expression is lost being sufficient to induce the activation of endogenous wild-type Ras proteins within the cell (see Figure 1B). Loss of PITX1 thus has the potential to have a similar effect to mutation of RAS genes in terms of activation of downstream Ras effector pathways |

Specifically, we did not identify a single patient with concurrent mutations in TET2 and in IDH1 or IDH2; 0/57 IDH1/2-mutant cases were TET2-mutant versus 28/300 IDH1/2-wild-type AML cases ( Figure 4).

This analysis allowed us to determine that TET2-mutant AMLs displayed a unique methylation signature consisting of 57 DMRs (p < 0.05 T+BH). IDH1/2-mutant AMLs also displayed a 57-DMR signature when compared to IDH1/2-wild-type and TET2-wild-type AMLs (>2 log2 methylation difference and p < 0.05 T+BH) ... Similar to the case of IDH1/2, there was a marked overall trend toward promoter hypermethylation in TET2-mutant AMLs compared to TET2- and IDH1/2-wild-type AMLs and to NBM CD34+ cells ( Figures 6C and 6D) ... We also examined whether loss of TET2 in cells resulted in a similar increase in 5-methylcytosine levels as did expression of mutant IDH1/2. Two independent short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were used to stably knock down TET2 in murine primary bone marrow cells. LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis revealed that expression of validated TET2 shRNA constructs or IDH1/2 mutations in murine primary bone marrow cells led to an ∼20% increase in 5-methylcytosine levels (Figure S4C).

Cotransfection of TET2 with IDH1 R132H, but not wild-type IDH1, reversed this increase in 5-OH-MeC (Figure 5A). To obtain a more quantitative assessment, we also performed flow cytometric analysis of 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity.

These data suggest that TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations form a distinct mutational class in AML, and that IDH1/2 mutations and TET2 mutations have overlapping roles in AML pathogenesis ... We therefore hypothesized that 2HG produced by mutant IDH might inhibit the hydroxylation reaction of 5-methylcytosine by TET2. To test this hypothesis, we expressed FLAG-tagged TET2 in 293T cells. Consistent with previous findings (Ito et al., 2010 and Tahiliani et al., 2009), cells expressing TET2 showed higher levels of 5-OH-MeC in the nucleus as detected by immunofluorescence staining with 5-OH-MeC-specific antibody. Cotransfection of TET2 with IDH1 R132H, but not wild-type IDH1, reversed this increase in 5-OH-MeC (Figure 5A). To obtain a more quantitative assessment, we also performed flow cytometric analysis of 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Staining with an anti-FLAG antibody allowed us to discriminate between TET2-positive and TET2-negative populations; importantly, the TET2-positive population showed an ∼4-fold increase in the 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Cotransfection with R132H mutant IDH1 led to an ∼40% decrease in the fluorescence intensity, whereas wild-type IDH1 had no significant impact on 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity (Figure 5B). Consistent with its proposed role in DNA demethylation, TET2 transfection also caused a decrease in 5-methylcytosine, which could be reversed by coexpression of IDH1 R132H mutant but not wild-type IDH1 (Figure S5).

Although in vivo studies will be needed to specifically delineate the effects of IDH1/2-mutant protein expression on stem/progenitor cell function and on hematopoietic differentiation, the data suggest that expression of IDH1/2 proteins in hematopoietic cells results in impairment of myeloid differentiation and increased expression of immature cell-surface markers. Consonant with these findings, we found that many of the genes hypermethylated in the context of IDH1/2-mutant AML contained DNA binding motifs for GATA1/GATA2 and EVI1, transcription factors known to play a role in leukemogenesis and in normal myeloid differentiation | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Together, these data suggest that expression of mutant IDH is able to inhibit the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine by TET2 and subsequent DNA demethylation ... TET2 loss of function would be anticipated to result in hypermethylation, and the data reported here support this scenario.

In this study, LGGs with IDH1/2 mutation tended to exhibit higher LINE-1 methylation although there was no statistical significance | Reference Offset:  ['1047-1571', '3955-4394', '47068-47865'] | Reference Text:  Mutational and epigenetic profiling of a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient cohort revealed that IDH1/2-mutant AMLs display global DNA hypermethylation and a specific hypermethylation signature. Furthermore, expression of 2HG-producing IDH alleles in cells induced global DNA hypermethylation. In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants ... The most prevalent such mutations identified to date affect the genes for cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and its mitochondrial homolog IDH2. IDH1 and IDH2 lesions occur in ∼70% of patients with lower-grade (grade II-III) brain tumors such as astrocytomas, as well as in secondary glioblastomas derived from lower-grade glial tumors ( Hartmann et al., 2009, Parsons et al., 2008, van den Bent et al., 2010 and Yan et al., 2009) ... In previous studies in glioma, it was suggested that IDH-mutant brain tumors were characterized by a methylator phenotype which favors the acquisition of IDH1/2 mutations ( Noushmehr et al., 2010). Alternatively, IDH1/2 mutations could be early events in the process of hematopoietic transformation and precede the stochastic acquisition and accumulation of epigenetic changes that eventually culminate in overt AML. However, our data suggest a more direct mechanistic link between IDH1/2 mutations and dysregulated epigenetic programming in leukemia cells. Specifically, our data suggest that DNA hypermethylation is a consequence of mutant IDH protein expression and that IDH1/2-mutant-mediated epigenetic effects contribute to AML pathogenesis. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants ... Consistent with previous findings (Ito et al., 2010 and Tahiliani et al., 2009), cells expressing TET2 showed higher levels of 5-OH-MeC in the nucleus as detected by immunofluorescence staining with 5-OH-MeC-specific antibody. Cotransfection of TET2 with IDH1 R132H, but not wild-type IDH1, reversed this increase in 5-OH-MeC (Figure 5A). To obtain a more quantitative assessment, we also performed flow cytometric analysis of 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Staining with an anti-FLAG antibody allowed us to discriminate between TET2-positive and TET2-negative populations; importantly, the TET2-positive population showed an ∼4-fold increase in the 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity. Cotransfection with R132H mutant IDH1 led to an ∼40% decrease in the fluorescence intensity, whereas wild-type IDH1 had no significant impact on 5-OH-MeC fluorescence intensity (Figure 5B). Consistent with its proposed role in DNA demethylation, TET2 transfection also caused a decrease in 5-methylcytosine, which could be reversed by coexpression of IDH1 R132H mutant but not wild-type IDH1 (Figure S5). Together, these data suggest that expression of mutant IDH is able to inhibit the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine by TET2 and subsequent DNA demethylation | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Specifically, we did not identify a single patient with concurrent mutations in TET2 and in IDH1 or IDH2; 0/57 IDH1/2-mutant cases were TET2-mutant versus 28/300 IDH1/2-wild-type AML cases ( Figure 4). These data suggest that TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations form a distinct mutational class in AML, and that IDH1/2 mutations and TET2 mutations have overlapping roles in AML pathogenesis ... The fact that IDH1/2 and TET2 mutations are mutually exclusive in AML and that IDH1/2 mutations induce hypermethylation and inhibit TET2-mediated 5-hydroxymethylation suggested that both mutations may function by altering the cytosine methylation profiles of hematopoietic cells ...

First, the rapid degradation of Mcl-1 following certain cytotoxic stimuli (Cuconati et al., 2003, Nijhawan et al., 2003 and Willis et al., 2005) (Figure 7 and Figure 8) may help to ensure irreversible commitment to apoptosis.

Its behavior mirrored that of the BH3-only protein Bad, which we showed recently to be a relatively weak killer because it cannot engage the more divergent Bcl-2 homolog Mcl-1 (Chen et al., 2005 and Willis et al., 2005). Recent studies argue that Mcl-1 has a critical, distinctive role in the control of apoptosis (Cuconati et al., 2003, Nijhawan et al., 2003 and Opferman et al., 2005). Indeed, we find that Mcl-1 greatly constrains the cytotoxic action of ABT-737. Accordingly, we show that several strategies for downregulating Mcl-1, some clinically applicable, render diverse cells highly sensitive to ABT-737, even in the face of high Bcl-2 expression ... Surprisingly, however, Bcl-2 overexpression did not prevent ABT-737-induced death (Figure 5C), even though its level was sufficient to inhibit Etoposide-induced apoptosis (Figure 5D). Thus, if Mcl-1 is inactivated, Bcl-2 overexpression does not diminish the cytotoxic activity of ABT-737, and Bcl-xL overexpression does so only moderately.

Since tumors often overexpress Bcl-2 (Tsujimoto et al., 1985) or Bcl-xL, we also tested the impact of their overexpression. Even when Mcl-1 was inactivated (by expressing Noxa), Bcl-xL overexpression conferred limited resistance to ABT-737 (Figure 5C), perhaps by raising the level of ABT-737 targets. Surprisingly, however, Bcl-2 overexpression did not prevent ABT-737-induced death (Figure 5C), even though its level was sufficient to inhibit Etoposide-induced apoptosis (Figure 5D). Thus, if Mcl-1 is inactivated, Bcl-2 overexpression does not diminish the cytotoxic activity of ABT-737, and Bcl-xL overexpression does so only moderately.

They then combined their data with those from previous studies on epigenetic markers. Using a variety of features such as evolutionary conservation and distance of the peak from the known miRNA genes, they assigned an ad hoc score to each putative TSS. A positive score indicated that the TSS is likely to belong to the miRNA and a negative score indicated that the TSS likely belonged to another gene. Although their study is very different than ours in the methodology followed (ChIP-chip vs. ChIP-seq) and the proteins targeted by the ChIP, comparing the two can be useful. Overall, we found the two datasets are comparable with respect to miRNA promoter characteristics. Furthermore, we ran the CPPP algorithm on their data and verified most of their predicted promoters. In particular, there are 44 TSSs associated with intergenic miRNAs with positive Marson score (after removing some inconsistent or mis-annotated TSSs, see Materials and Methods); and CPPP scored all but three of them as likely to contain a core promoter (see Supplementary Data). The two datasets (ours and Marson's) include one miRNA gene and one miRNA cluster with well studied TSSs: cluster miR-23a~miR-27a~miR-24-2 [5], and gene miR-21 [26]. CPPP correctly identified the location of both known TSSs, while the Marson dataset only found the correct TSS for the miR-23a cluster (see Supplementary Data.) |

Some of the validated targets include well-known downstream elements of KRAS signaling such as components of the mitogenic RAF/MEK/ERK cascade and the PI3K/AKT survival pathway, most of which are druggable kinases (Gupta et al., 2007, Engelman et al., 2008 and Blasco et al., 2011) (Figure 1A) | Reference Offset:  ['2837-3175', '41320-41421', '43824-43938'] | Reference Text:  To date, multiple Ras downstream effectors have been identified. It is generally accepted that the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade of kinases is the primary mediator of mitogenic activity (Marshall, 1994). Another well-known pathway, the PI3Kinase/Pdk/Akt pathway, is thought to mediate survival signals (Cully et al., 2006 and Engelman et al., 2006) ... K-RAS oncogenes signal through a cascade of downstream effectors, most of which are druggable kinases ... The immediate Ras downstream effectors within the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway are the Raf kinases, A-Raf, B-Raf, and c-Raf | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Thus, neither B-Raf nor A-Raf could compensate for the lack of c-Raf. Because K-Ras is the Ras isoform that binds and activates c-Raf more efficiently ( Voice et al., 1999), it is possible that c-Raf might be essential to mediate K-Ras signaling to the Mek and Erk kinases, at least in an oncogenic setting. Indeed, oncogenic RAS exclusively signaled via c-RAF to the ERK-MAPK pathway in human melanoma cell lines ( Dumaz et al., 2006). However, it is also possible that c-Raf, but not B-Raf or A-Raf, may modulate an alternative downstream pathway essential for malignant transformation ( Takezawa et al., 2009), but not for normal homeostasis.

When we examined K-Ras+/G12V;Erk1−/−;Erk2lox/lox mice 6 months after turning on K-RasG12V expression, we observed very few tumors compared to control animals ( Figures 2B and 2C). More importantly, all tumors tested (n = 6) displayed a prominent band corresponding to the nonrecombined Erk2lox allele and expressed normal levels of Erk2, indicating that these tumors were “escapers” ( Figure 2D).

To examine whether they also played unique roles during K-RasG12V-driven NSCLC, we crossed K-Ras+/G12V mice with B-Raflox/lox ( Chen et al., 2006) and c-Raflox/lox ( Jesenberger et al., 2001) animals and submitted them to infection with Ad-Cre particles. As illustrated in Figure 5A, conditional ablation of B-Raflox alleles in K-RasG12V-induced NSCLC did not increase survival (50% survival of K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raflox/lox mice [n = 25] at 41.5 versus 40 weeks in K-Ras+/G12V;B-Raf+/+ control animals [n = 28], a 5% increase). The number and grade of tumors in mice lacking B-Raf 6 months after Ad-Cre treatment were similar to those present in control mice ( Figures 5B and 5C). Efficient recombination of the B-Raflox alleles in tumor tissue was determined by Southern ( Figure S5) and western ( Figure 5D) blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry staining with an anti-B-Raf antibody further confirmed the absence of B-Raf expression in tumor tissue ( Figure 5E). Interestingly, elimination of B-Raf expression had no effect on the levels of Mek and Erk phosphorylation, as determined by either western blot ( Figure 5D) or immunohistochemical ( Figure 5E) analysis. These observations suggest that in the absence of B-Raf, other Raf proteins can maintain mitogenic signaling through the Mek/Erk pathway. This compensatory effect did not involve increased expression of the other Raf kinases ( Figure 5D) ... Next, we investigated whether c-Raf kinase was also dispensable for K-RasG12V-driven NSCLCs. Ad-Cre treated K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice survived significantly longer than the control cohort. Whereas 50% of K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raf+/+ animals (n = 22) had to be sacrificed by 38 weeks of age, half of K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice (n = 23) were alive at 63 weeks. This difference represents an 83% increase in survival ( Figure 6A). As expected, this increased survival was a direct consequence of the reduced number of tumors present in K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice 6 months after Ad-Cre treatment ( Figures 6B and 6C). More importantly, each tumor tested (n = 11) retained c-Raflox alleles ( Figure 6D). These results were confirmed by western blot analysis of nine independent tumors ( Figure 6D). These observations indicate that NSCLCs driven by K-RasG12V cannot develop in the absence of c-Raf and that the tumors responsible for the death of the K-Ras+/G12V;c-Raflox/lox mice must be “escapers,” as previously observed in mice lacking Erk1/2 and Mek1/2 kinases ...

Necropsy analysis of moribund mice reveled multiple defects, including severe alterations in the structure of intestinal and colonic tissue incompatible with life (Figure S4B).

In their active conformation G proteins interact with effector proteins, which induce downstream signaling events. The GDP-GTP cycle is highly regulated by GEFs that induce the release of the bound GDP to be replaced by the more abundant GTP and by GAPs that usually provide an essential catalytic group for GTP hydrolysis ... For a subset of small G proteins (mainly for Rab and Rho proteins) guanine nucleotide-dissociation inhibitors provide an additional level of control.

In general the affinity of the G protein for GTP and GDP is similar, and the GEF does not favor rebinding of GDP or GTP. Thus the resulting increase in GTP-bound over GDP-bound is due to the approximately ten times higher cellular concentration of GTP compared to GDP. As shown first for the interaction between the RanGEF RCC1 and Ran the affinities of the binary complexes between the G protein and either the nucleotide or its GEF are very high. In contrast, the affinities of the exchange factor for the nucleotide-bound G protein and of the nucleotide for the exchange-factor-bound G protein (the ternary complexes) are much lower (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001). Thus, the interaction of a GEF weakens the affinity for the nucleotide, and visa versa, the nucleotide weakens the affinity for the GEF. In the course of the exchange reaction the GEF displaces the bound nucleotide, and subsequently a new nucleotide displaces the GEF (Figure 2A) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

In addition to the catalytic Sec7 domain both groups contain a PH domain. The activity of the large ArfGEFs was found to be inhibited by the natural compound Brefeldin A, resulting in the collapse of the Golgi structure. Brefeldin A stabilizes the ternary ARF-GDP-GEF complex and thus traps the GEF in an unproductive complex with its substrate. Structural analysis revealed that Brefeldin A binds at the binding interface between the Sec7 domain and Arf1 and thereby stabilizes the interaction (Renault et al., 2003). An elegant approach to identify inhibitors for GEFs was recently reported for the small ArfGEFs. M69 was identified in a library of RNA aptomers due to its ability to inhibit Cytohesin-1 activity in vitro (Mayer et al., 2001). Subsequently, a chemical library was screened for molecules that could compete with M69 for binding to Cytohesin-1 resulting in identification of SecinH3. SecinH3 inhibited the ARNO and Cytohesin-1 with an IC50 in the low micromolar range in vitro.

In general the affinity of the G protein for GTP and GDP is similar, and the GEF does not favor rebinding of GDP or GTP. Thus the resulting increase in GTP-bound over GDP-bound is due to the approximately ten times higher cellular concentration of GTP compared to GDP. As shown first for the interaction between the RanGEF RCC1 and Ran the affinities of the binary complexes between the G protein and either the nucleotide or its GEF are very high. In contrast, the affinities of the exchange factor for the nucleotide-bound G protein and of the nucleotide for the exchange-factor-bound G protein (the ternary complexes) are much lower (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001). Thus, the interaction of a GEF weakens the affinity for the nucleotide, and visa versa, the nucleotide weakens the affinity for the GEF. In the course of the exchange reaction the GEF displaces the bound nucleotide, and subsequently a new nucleotide displaces the GEF (Figure 2A) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

The G-protein-bound nucleotide is sandwiched between two loops called switch 1 and switch 2. The switch regions together with the phosphate-binding loop (P loop) interact with the phosphates and a coordinating magnesium ion. Both phosphates and the magnesium ion are essential for the high-affinity binding of the nucleotide to the G protein (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001). The action of the GEF on the G protein was analyzed in several structural studies. Due to the inherent instability of the ternary complexes most structural studies have been performed with stable binary complexes between GEFs and G proteins (Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998, Worthylake et al., 2000, Renault et al., 2001, Goldberg, 1998 and Itzen et al., 2006). These have revealed that the catalytic domains of the various families of GEFs are structurally unrelated and approach the G proteins from different angles (Figure 2B). However, they all use similar principles to deform the nucleotide-binding site. GEF binding induces conformational changes in the switch regions and the P loop, while leaving the remainder of the structure largely unperturbed | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Several elegant studies have illustrated the importance of metabolic transformation in cancer development (Freed-Pastor et al., 2012; Locasale et al., 2011; Schafer et al., 2009; Ying et al., 2012), although there is limited information about how these metabolic changes may impact on tumorigenicity in vivo | Reference Offset:  ['28058-28939', '29631-30542'] | Reference Text:  The reprogramming of cellular metabolism to support continuous proliferation is a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Our analysis in vivo following KrasG12D extinction showed rapid downregulation of specific metabolic enzymes and their pathways prior to any discernible biological impact (e.g., morphological or proliferative changes), a finding consistent with the active control of tumor cell metabolism by KrasG12D. Indeed, the Kras oncogene is known to induce aerobic glycolysis (Racker et al., 1985), and PDAC cells have been shown previously to have metabolism consistent with elevated aerobic glycolysis (Zhou et al., 2011). Interestingly, this metabolic switch may be dependent on cell type or oncogenic Ras isoform as H-Ras transformed mesenchymal stem cells do not depend on increased glycolysis for ATP production during transformation (Funes et al., 2007) ... Our work establishes that KrasG12D extinction leads to inhibition of glucose uptake and a decrease in several glycolytic intermediates, including G6P, F6P, and FBP. Although aerobic glycolysis is recognized as inefficient from a bioenergetics perspective, metabolic reprogramming to a glycolytic state has been proposed as a mechanism which allows the allocation of glycolytic intermediates into biosynthetic pathways (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). Indeed, we have demonstrated the enhanced glycolytic flux is diverted into the nonoxidative PPP to facilitate ribose biogenesis. Furthermore, such hypotheses are also supported by the observation that amplification/overexpression of PHGDH, a rate-limiting enzyme functioning to divert 3-phospho-glycerate (a glycolytic intermediate) into the serine biosynthesis pathway, facilitates tumor growth in certain contexts (Locasale et al., 2011; Possemato et al., 2011) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

These mice were crossed to ROSA26-LSL-rtTA-IRES-GFP (ROSA_rtTA) (Belteki et al., 2005) and p48-Cre (Kawaguchi et al., 2002) mice to enable pancreas-specific and doxycycline (doxy)-inducible expression of KrasG12D (Figure S1B). This triple transgenic strain is designated hereafter as iKras. Doxy treatment effectively induced oncogenic Kras expression and activity (Figures S1C and S1D), but did not substantially increase total Kras expression at the mRNA or protein levels (Figures S1C and S1E). Extinction of the KrasG12D transgene occurs within 24 hr following doxy withdrawal (Figures S1C and S1D) ... Consistent with the role of KrasG12D as a driver of PDAC initiation (Hezel et al., 2006), doxy induction provokes acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and PanIN lesions within 2 weeks (Figure S1F). Similar to the LSL-KrasG12D knock-in model, induction of the KrasG12D transgene leads to infrequent occurrence of invasive PDAC after long latency (35–70 weeks) (Figure S1F), suggesting comparable biological activity of the KrasG12D alleles and the need for additional genetic events for tumor progression. To enable full malignant progression and assess the tumor maintenance role of KrasG12D in advanced malignancies, we crossed iKras and conditional p53 knockout (p53L) alleles (Marino et al., 2000). Following doxy treatment at 3 weeks of age, all iKras p53L/+ mice succumbed to PDAC between 11 and 25 weeks of age (median survival, 15 weeks), whereas the doxy-treated iKras p53L/L mice succumbed to PDAC more rapidly with a median survival of 7.9 weeks (Figure 1A). The iKras p53 mutant tumors exhibited features commonly found in human PDAC, including glandular tumor structures, exuberant stroma, local invasion into surrounding structures such as the duodenum, and distant metastases to the liver and lung (Figure 1B).

Gfpt1 knockdown also inhibited the clonogenic and soft-agar growth of tumor cells from both the iKras p53L/+ and the LSL-KrasG12D p53L/+ tumor cells (Figures 5G and 5H) and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo (Figure 5I).

As shown in Figure 1C, KrasG12D extinction led to rapid tumor regression with morphological deterioration of tumor cells and rapid degeneration of stromal elements starting 48 hr and peaking at 72 hr following doxy withdrawal. After 1 week of doxy withdrawal, MRI showed a reduction in tumor mass of ~50%, whereas PET/CT showed complete loss of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake (Figures 1D and 1E). On the histopathological level, virtually all malignant components of the tumor regressed with the remaining pancreata displaying collagen deposition surrounding few remnant ductal structures (Figure 1C). Correspondingly, tumor regression was accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation (BrdU incorporation) and increased apoptosis (Caspase-3 activation) 2–3 days after doxy withdrawal, culminating in complete loss of tumor cell proliferation at 1 week off doxy (Figures 2A and S2A; data not shown). Moreover, KrasG12D extinction effected dramatic changes in the tumor stroma as evidenced by a reduction in pancreatic stellate cells (marked by SMA staining) (Figure 2A), which is a prominent component of the classical stromal reaction in PDAC. This indicates that oncogenic Kras has significant non-cell-autonomous effects on the stromal compartment. The in vivo findings of decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of the epithelial compartment parallel cell culture assays, such as loss of clonogenic growth of primary tumor cells (Figure S2B), consistent with a role for cell-autonomous mechanisms contributing to tumor regression | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Correspondingly, downregulation of the rate-limiting enzyme, Gfpt1, was documented at the transcriptional and protein levels (Figures 5C and 5D) ... To further substantiate the essentiality of KrasG12D-mediated control of protein glycosylation, we assessed the impact of shRNA knockdown of Gfpt1. Consistent with its pivotal role in providing protein glycosylation substrates, Gfpt1 knockdown reduced the overall O-linked glycosylation to a level similar to that of tumor cells in which KrasG12D is extinguished (Figure 5F). Gfpt1 knockdown also inhibited the clonogenic and soft-agar growth of tumor cells from both the iKras p53L/+ and the LSL-KrasG12D p53L/+ tumor cells (Figures 5G and 5H) and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo (Figure 5I). Notably, tumors that emerged in the Gfpt1 knockdown group showed recovery of Gfpt1 expression (Figure S5B). Thus, KrasG12D-mediated tumor maintenance is at least partially dependent upon its stimulation of the HBP and associated protein glycosylation | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Both PanINs and PDA exhibit Kras mutations, which may be an initiating event. Mouse models support this notion as targeted and persistent expression of mutant Kras in the mouse pancreatic epithelium both recapitulates the PanIN to PDA sequence observed in humans, and is required for disease maintenance [1], [2], [3] | Reference Offset:  ['5995-7322', '2077-2425'] | Reference Text:  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the most lethal cancers with a 5-year survival rate of ~5% (Hidalgo, 2010).

Consistent with the role of KrasG12D as a driver of PDAC initiation (Hezel et al., 2006), doxy induction provokes acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and PanIN lesions within 2 weeks (Figure S1F). Similar to the LSL-KrasG12D knock-in model, induction of the KrasG12D transgene leads to infrequent occurrence of invasive PDAC after long latency (35–70 weeks) (Figure S1F), suggesting comparable biological activity of the KrasG12D alleles and the need for additional genetic events for tumor progression. To enable full malignant progression and assess the tumor maintenance role of KrasG12D in advanced malignancies, we crossed iKras and conditional p53 knockout (p53L) alleles (Marino et al., 2000). Following doxy treatment at 3 weeks of age, all iKras p53L/+ mice succumbed to PDAC between 11 and 25 weeks of age (median survival, 15 weeks), whereas the doxy-treated iKras p53L/L mice succumbed to PDAC more rapidly with a median survival of 7.9 weeks (Figure 1A). The iKras p53 mutant tumors exhibited features commonly found in human PDAC, including glandular tumor structures, exuberant stroma, local invasion into surrounding structures such as the duodenum, and distant metastases to the liver and lung (Figure 1B).

As such, we hypothesized that the flux of glucose into the nonoxidative arm of the PPP by KrasG12D occurs to provide tumor cells with sufficient R5P for DNA/RNA biosynthesis. To explore this possibility, we used 14C1- or 14C6-labeled glucose to track the contribution of oxidative versus nonoxidative PPP into DNA and RNA. Whereas 14 C6-labeled glucose will give rise to radioactive DNA/RNA whether it is used by the oxidative or the nonoxidative arm of the PPP, 14C1-labeled glucose will only give rise to radioactive DNA/RNA if it is used by the nonoxidative arm (the 14C1 label is lost as CO2 through the oxidative arm; Figure S6B). As shown in Figure 6E, KrasG12D extinction leads to dramatic drop in the incorporation of both 14C1- and 14C6-labeled glucose into DNA/RNA, clearly demonstrating a predominant and KrasG12D-mediated role for the nonoxidative arm of the PPP in R5P-biogenesis.

Additionally, it has been shown that the Ras oncogene promotes resistance to oxidative stress through GSH-based ROS scavenger pathways (DeNicola et al., 2011; Recktenwald et al., 2008), and this is likely mediated in part by the production of NADPH through the oxidative arm of the PPP. In fact, the oxidative arm of the PPP has been shown to be activated by Kras oncogene-mediated transformation to promote cell proliferation (Vizan et al., 2005; Weinberg et al., 2010).

The same clustering method was also used to group the leukemia samples on the basis of similarities in their pattern of genes expressed (see Supplemental Data at http://www.stjuderesearch.org/data/ALL1). Remarkably, this analysis clearly identified six major leukemia subtypes that corresponded to T-ALL, hyperdiploid with >50 chromosomes, BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, and MLL gene rearrangement. Moreover, within the heterogeneous collection of leukemias that were not assigned to one of these subtypes, a subgroup of 14 cases was identified that had a distinct gene expression profile. These cases had normal, pseudodiploid, or hyperdiploid karyotypes and lacked any consistent cytogenetic abnormality ...

Interestingly, the relative effect of GATA2 loss on viability correlated with the extent of GATA2 knockdown in mutant but not WT cells ( Figure S1B) ... To further validate GATA2, we designed shRNAs against GATA2. To this end, one shRNA (shGATA2.1) achieved substantial knockdown of GATA2 in A549 and PC9 cells relative to a control (shGAPDH) and a nonfunctional GATA2 shRNA (shGATA2.2) (Figure 1C).

As seen in Figure 2A, injection of control shRNA-expressing RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC cells led to robust tumor growth. In contrast, GATA2 knockdown cells completely abrogated tumor formation, with no detectable lesions forming over 9 months.

In particular, the proteasome, and indirectly NF-κB, can be inhibited with the FDA-licensed drug bortezomib and the Rho/ROCK-signaling cascade with fasudil, which has been approved for clinical use in Japan. To examine combined inhibition of these pathways on KRAS mutant NSCLC, we first treated a subset of KRAS mutant and WT cells with the individual drugs and their combination.

Eight weeks after infection, we compared the cohort histopathologically and observed a very large reduction in tumor burden in KG F/F animals compared to both KG +/+ and F/+ controls ( Figures 6A and 6B). Moreover, both KG F/+ and KG F/F mice exhibited a significant decrease in tumor number relative to KG +/+ controls, with KG F/F animals exhibiting a more striking decline ( Figure 6C) ... In contrast, the average sizes of the tumors that did arise were comparable among KG +/+, F/+, and F/F mice ( Figure 6D). To characterize the tumors in KG F/F mice, we prepared DNA from these lesions and analyzed recombination. Intriguingly, tumors from KG F/F mice retained an unrecombined floxed Gata2 allele, whereas the Kras allele was completely recombined in the same lesions ( Figure 6E). Taken together, these results indicate that Gata2 is requisite for oncogenic Kras-driven lung tumor initiation | Discourse Facet:  Method_Citation | Annotator:  H, |

To address this, we used small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against both KRAS and GATA2 in the NSCLC cell lines A549 (KRAS mutant), PC9 (EGFR mutant), and H322M (WT). As expected, A549 cells exhibited reduced viability with loss of either KRAS or GATA2, whereas H322M cells were unaffected ( Figure 1B) ... To further validate GATA2, we designed shRNAs against GATA2. To this end, one shRNA (shGATA2.1) achieved substantial knockdown of GATA2 in A549 and PC9 cells relative to a control (shGAPDH) and a nonfunctional GATA2 shRNA (shGATA2.2) (Figure 1C). Notably, shGATA2.1-expressing A549 and PC9 cells had greatly reduced viability relative to the other shRNAs but did not affect WT H322M cells (Figure 1D).

The measured binding activity of BID SAHBA's interaction with full-length BAX (EC50, 885 nM) is lower than that reported for BH3 peptide interactions with antiapoptotic targets. This apparent discrepancy may be explained in part by the differential binding activities of synthetic BH3 peptides for full-length versus C-terminally deleted multidomain apoptotic targets, which are predominant in the literature (e.g., Certo et al., 2006, Chen et al., 2005, Degterev et al., 2001, Kelekar et al., 1997, Letai et al., 2002 and Opferman et al., 2003, and Sattler et al., 1997) |
