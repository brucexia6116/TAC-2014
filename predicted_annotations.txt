Broad application of this library has already been reported in numerous publications on the identification of human disease-related genes [4], [5] and [6]. The TRC library appears to have advantages over conventional synthetic small interference RNA (siRNA) libraries. Transfection of synthetic siRNA only evokes transient gene silencing often accompanied with non-specific or toxic effects, and many types of mammalian cells are ineffective or resistant to the transfection [7]. Lentiviral vector delivery of RNAi possesses great advantages over raw siRNA applications owing to their wide-range tropism, genomic integration property and effective in vitro delivery | Discourse facet: Results_Citation

(2005) | Citation Offset:  6288-7456 | Citation Text:  Kolfschoten et al. (2005) identified a number of genes in their screen, a couple of which had previously been implicated as possible tumor suppressors. They concentrated, however, on the homeodomain transcription factor PITX1. Knockdown of this gene allows fibroblasts to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. The mechanism appears to involve constitutive activation of the Ras signaling pathways at the level of GTP loading onto Ras itself, suggesting that PITX1 might control the expression of one of the negative regulators of Ras of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. An analysis of the sequences of the promoters of the eight human genes encoding Ras GAPs led them to concentrate on RASAL1, a calcium-sensitive member of the family (Walker et al., 2004). PITX1 directly controls the expression of RASAL1, with the reduction in GAP activity when PITX1 and consequently RASAL1 expression is lost being sufficient to induce the activation of endogenous wild-type Ras proteins within the cell (see Figure 1B). Loss of PITX1 thus has the potential to have a similar effect to mutation of RAS genes in terms of activation of downstream Ras effector pathways | Discourse facet: Discussion_Citation

They then combined their data with those from previous studies on epigenetic markers. Using a variety of features such as evolutionary conservation and distance of the peak from the known miRNA genes, they assigned an ad hoc score to each putative TSS. A positive score indicated that the TSS is likely to belong to the miRNA and a negative score indicated that the TSS likely belonged to another gene. Although their study is very different than ours in the methodology followed (ChIP-chip vs. ChIP-seq) and the proteins targeted by the ChIP, comparing the two can be useful. Overall, we found the two datasets are comparable with respect to miRNA promoter characteristics. Furthermore, we ran the CPPP algorithm on their data and verified most of their predicted promoters. In particular, there are 44 TSSs associated with intergenic miRNAs with positive Marson score (after removing some inconsistent or mis-annotated TSSs, see Materials and Methods); and CPPP scored all but three of them as likely to contain a core promoter (see Supplementary Data). The two datasets (ours and Marson's) include one miRNA gene and one miRNA cluster with well studied TSSs: cluster miR-23a~miR-27a~miR-24-2 [5], and gene miR-21 [26]. CPPP correctly identified the location of both known TSSs, while the Marson dataset only found the correct TSS for the miR-23a cluster (see Supplementary Data.) | Discourse facet: Results_Citation
